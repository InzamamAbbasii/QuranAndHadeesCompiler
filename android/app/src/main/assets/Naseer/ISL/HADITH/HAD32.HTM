<P>1. "O thou who art clothed! Arise and warn, and thy Lord do magnify, and thy garments keep purified, and uncleanness do shun" (74:1-5).</P>
<P>2. "Say, Who has prohibited the adornment of All&acirc;h which He has brought forth for His servants and the goodly provisions" (7: 32).</P>
<P>3. "O children of Adam! Attend to your embellishment at every time of prayer" (7:31).</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The order to keep the garments pure and shun uncleanness of every kind is combined with the order to warn the people and magnify the Lord (v. 1). This shows the importance which is given to cleanliness in dress as well as in general habits. Adornment is not prohibited; it is, in fact, a thanksgiving for Divine blessings (v. 2). The word adornment (Ar. <I>zinah</I>), which is generally taken to mean apparel, includes both the dress and the make-up of a person. A good toilet is recommended even when going to prayer (v. 3). No limitations are placed upon the form or quality of clothing but extravagance and vanity must be avoided (h. 1 ). To be naked is forbidden (h. 2 ). Men are prohibited to wear silk except for a good reason, but women may wear it (hh. 3-6). Men may wear a silver ring but not a gold one, but women may wear any ornaments (hh. 7-10). The personal make-up of a man, the wearing of a moustache, beard and hair, and the use of perfumes are spoken of in hh. 11-16, while, hh. 17-20 relate to pictures or decorations.</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT></B> The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Eat and drink and wear clothes and be charitable,</P>
<P>{p. 360}</P>
<P>not being extravagant or self- conceited."[1]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:1.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT></B> Miswar said,</P>
<P>I took up a heavy stone, and whilst I was going along (with it), my garment fell down. So the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said to me: "Don on thy garment, and you should not walk naked."[2]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(AD. 30:2.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; 'Uthm&acirc;n reported, A letter from 'Umar came to us that the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, forbade us (wearing of) silk except this much,</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Those who wear long garments, or trail the train of the garment, in order to be looked at or for vanity are censured (B. 77:4, 5), but the mere wearing of a long garment is not forbidden (B. 77:2).</P>
<P>2. The parts of the body which must be covered are called the <I>'aurah</I>, which is thus defined: The part or parts of the body which it is indecent to expose; in a man what is between the navel and the knee, and in a free woman all the person except the face and the hands as far as the wrist" (LL).</P>
<P>To be naked even in private (except in case of necessity) is forbidden, as the Holy Prophet is reported to have said in answer to such a question "All&acirc;h has a greater right than men that one should be ashamed of Him" (AD. 30: 2).]</P>

<P>and he pointed with his two fingers that are next to the thumb. He said, According to our knowledge, he meant <I>a'l&acirc;m</I>.[3]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:25.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT></B> Anas said,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, allowed the wearing of silk to Zubair and 'Abd al-Rahm&acirc;n on account of itching.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:29.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>5</FONT></B> Anas reported, He saw Umm Kulth&ucirc;m, the daughter of the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, wearing a striped garment of silk.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:30.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[3. <I>'A'l&acirc;m</I> is the plural of <I>'alam</I> which means an impression or a trace, and the <I>a'l&acirc;m</I> of a garment is the <I>ornamental</I> or <I>variegated border thereof</I> (LL). The wearing of silk is prohibited for men, except for special reasons, but not for women, because men must be accustomed to lead a hard life. The wearing of <I>khazz</I> (a cloth woven of wool and silk) is allowed (Ah. iv, 233)]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 362}</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>6</FONT></B> 'Uqbah ibn '&Acirc;mir said,</P>
<P>A tunic of silk[4] was presented to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and he wore it, and said his prayers while wearing it; then he pulled it off, doffing it severely, like one hating it. and said: "This is not fit for the righteous.[5]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 8:16.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>7</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Hurairah reported on the authority of the Prophet, of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>,</P>
<P>That he forbade the wearing of a gold ring.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:45.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>8</FONT></B> Anas said, When the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, intended to write to the Romans, it was said to him that they would not read his letter</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[4. <I>Farr&ucirc;j</I> is a garment of the kind called <I>qab&acirc;'</I> (a kind of tunic), <I>having a slit in its hinder part</I> (LL).</P>

<P>if it did not bear a seal. So he ordered a ring of silver to be made and its impress was Muhammad the Messenger of All&acirc;h.[6]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:52 )</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>9</FONT></B> Ibn 'Abb&acirc;s said, I bear witness regarding the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, that the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, went out and Bil&acirc;l was with him, and he thought that he had not made the women hear; so he exhorted them and ordered them to give in charity, and the women began to throw (their) earrings and rings, and Bil&acirc;l gathered them in a side of his garment.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 3:32.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[6. The Holy Prophet had a ring made for him when letters were written to the neighbouring potentates in the year 6 A.H., and upon the signet of it were engraved the words <I>Muhammad Ras&ucirc;l All&acirc;h</I>. These three words were written as another had&icirc;th shows, in three lines, All&acirc;h being at the top, <I>Ras&ucirc;l</I> in the middle and <I>Muhammad</I> at the bottom.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 364}</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>10</FONT></B> Umm Salamah said,</P>
<P>I used to wear ornaments of gold, so I said, "Is it hoarding up, O Messenger of All&acirc;h?" He said: "What reaches the limit of zak&acirc;t, and zak&acirc;t is paid therefrom, it is not hoarding up."[7]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(AD. 9:4.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>11</FONT></B> Abu Hurairah reported,</P>
<P>Five things are according to nature: Circumcision, and the removal of superfluous hair,[8] and the removal of hair in the armpit, and the paring of nails, and the clipping of the moustache.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:63.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[7. These had&icirc;th show that ornaments of all kinds are allowed for women. Umm Salamah was the Holy Prophet's wife.</P>
<P>8. Superfluous hair below the navel is meant. Istihd&acirc;d means shaving with a razor.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 365}</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>12</FONT></B> Ibn 'Umar reported,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said: "Oppose the polytheists--leave the beard to grow abundant and clip the moustaches."[9] And when Ibn 'Umar performed the pilgrimage or the <I>'umrah</I>, he used to grasp his beard with his hand; what exceeded, he had it cut off.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:64.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>13</FONT></B> Ibn 'Abb&acirc;s reported,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, used to let down his hair (on his forehead), the polytheists combing their hair into two parts throwing them on the two sides, while the followers of the Book used to let down their hair (on their foreheads). The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, preferred agreement with the followers of the Book in matters in which he was not ordered (to follow) a</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[9. It shows that the polytheists generally shaved the beard.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 366}</P>
<P>particular course. Then (afterwards) the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, combed his hair into two parts.' [10]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 61:21)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>14</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah said,</P>
<P>I used to comb the hair of the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 6:2.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>15</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah reported,</P>
<P>It was pleasing to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, to begin on the right side, so far as he was able, in his combing (of the hair) and in his ablutions.[11]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:77.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>16</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah said, I used to perfume the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, with</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[10. This had&icirc;th shows that the Holy Prophet wore his hair in different ways at different times, and he never forbade a particular way of wearing one's hair. <I>Sadl</I> (or the Christian way of wearing one's hair) was leaving a lock of hair on the forehead, while <I>farq</I> (or the Arab way) was letting down of the hair on the two sides with a line between them. The Holy Prophet did it in both ways at different times. Another had&icirc;th speaks of the <I>dhaw&acirc;'ib</I> (tuft of hair on the forehead) of Ibn 'Abb&acirc;s (B. 77: 71.)</P>
<P>11. These had&icirc;th show that the Holy Prophet was careful about his toilet.]</P>

<P>the best fragrant substance which he could find, so much so that I could discern the brightness of the fragrance in his head and in his beard.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:74.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>17</FONT></B> Busr ibn Sa'id related,</P>
<P>Zaid ibn Kh&acirc;lid spoke to him, while with Busr ibn Sa'id was 'Ubaid All&acirc;h, that Ab&ucirc; Talhah related to him that the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said: "Angels do not enter a house in which is an image."[12] Busr said, After this Zaid ibn Kh&acirc;lid fell ill and we paid</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[12. 'S&ucirc;rah means an image or a picture. According to another version (B. 59: 7), the Holy Prophet is reported to have said that "Angels do not enter a house in which is a dog or a s&ucirc;rah." But the Holy Qur'&acirc;n allows the keeping of dogs for hunting (5: 4), and so does Had&icirc;th (H. xxviii:8); and the keeping of watchdogs is also allowed. Similarly, the Holy Qur'&acirc;n speaks of <I>tam&acirc;th&icirc;l</I> ( images ) being made for Solomon, and it would not be right to say that angels did not on this account come into the house of Solomon, a prophet of God. The had&icirc;th, therefore, which speaks of angels not visiting a place where images (or pictures) and dogs are to be found cannot be accepted in a literal sense. It is for this reason that an authority like R&acirc;ghib interprets the word <I>bait</I> (<I>house</I>) occurring {footnote p. 368} in this Had&icirc;th as meaning the heart, the significance being that the man in whose heart images or idols have a place, and who bows before them, does not receive the angels of Divine mercy. The concluding words of this had&icirc;th, making an exception in favour of <I>raqm fi-l-thaub</I>--(figures on a cloth)--and the same would be the case with regard to figures on a paper--confirm the conclusion arrived at above. What is forbidden is the keeping of images or pictures for paying them Divine honours.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 368}</P>
<P>a visit to him, and when we were in his house we saw a curtain on which were pictures. So I said to 'Ubaid All&acirc;h, Did he not relate to us about pictures? He said, He had said, Except figures on a cloth; didst thou not hear him? I said, No. He said, Yea! He mentioned this.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 59:7.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>18</FONT></B> Abd All&acirc;h Ibn 'Umar ' reported,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said: "Those who make these images (<I>suwar</I>) will be punished on the day of resurrection it will be said to them,</P>
<P>{p. 369}</P>
<P>Put life into what you made."[13]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:89.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>19</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah reported,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, did not leave in his house anything on which were figures but he broke it.[14]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 77:90.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>20</FONT></B> Ibn 'Umar said.</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, came to the house of F&acirc;timah but did not enter it. When 'Al&icirc; came, she mentioned it to him. He spoke about it to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and he (the Prophet) said: "I saw on her door a figured curtain." And he said: "I</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[13. As made clear in the previous note, only such people could be threatened with punishment as made images for worship.</P>
<P>14. It may be due simply to his love for simplicity and hatred of decorations, This is made clear in the next had&icirc;th which states that the Holy Prophet disliked a figured curtain on the door of his daughter F&acirc;timah, and asked her to send the same to people who stood in need of it. It did not mean that he prohibited the use of decorated or figured cloth; otherwise he would not have sent the same to others. Perhaps he only wanted his daughter to live a simple life like himself.]</P>

<P>have nothing to do with (decorations of) this world." So 'Al&icirc; came to her and mentioned this to her. She said, Let him command me about it as he likes. He (the Prophet) said: "Send it to such and such people; they are in need."</P>
