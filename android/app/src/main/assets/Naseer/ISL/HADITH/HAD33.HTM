<P>The word <I>adab</I> signifies <I>discipline of the mind</I>, or <I>every praiseworthy discipline by which a man is trained in any excellence</I>. Good morals and good manners are the real test of a man's excellence (v. 1; hh. 1, 9). Goodness to one's parents occupies a very high place in the moral code of Isl&acirc;m, the mother coming first (v. 2: h. 2), so much so that paradise is said to be beneath the mother's feet.</P>
<P>3). Kindness and love for children is inculcated (vv. 3. 4 . hh. 4, 5), and suffering on account of them is called a screen from fire (h. 6). Doing good to relatives is a source of blessings in this life and the next (v. 4; hh. 7, 8). Wives have their rights over their husbands and they must be kept in good fellowship (vv. 6, 7). The best of men is said to be one who is kindest to his wife (h. 9). and it is recommended that one should help her in her work (h. 10). Muslims</P>
<P>{p. 373}</P>
<P>are brethren--members of one body and parts of one structure-and they must help one another and he kind to one another (vv. 8. 9: hh. 11-14); their blood, property and honour being inviolable (h. 15). They are forbidden to hate and boycott one another (h. 16), to call one another <I>k&acirc;fir</I> or <I>f&acirc;siq</I> (h. 17), and to fight with one another (h. 18). A neighbour, whether a Muslim or a non-Muslim, must be treated kindly (hh. 19. 20). One must be kind and generous to one's slaves or servants, who must in all other matters be treated on a basis of equality (hh. 21-23). Looking after widows and orphans is an act of highest merit (hh. 24. 25). Even an enemy must be treated generously (hh. 26, 27). Divine mercy is shown to him who is merciful to God's creatures (hh. 28, 29), even to dumb animals (h. 30). Man must cultivate the habit of being truthful, for truth is the basis from which virtue spring., while falsehood leads to vice (v. 10; h. 31). Special stress is laid that a man must be fair and forgiving in his dealings with other people, and must avoid everything which hurts them (vv. 11-19; h. 32) At the end are given a few verses and had&icirc;th relating to good manners (vv. 20-22; hh. 33-41).</P>
<P>Many aspects of this subject have been. incidentally, dealt with in the foregoing chapters.</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>1</FONT></B> Abd All&acirc;h ibn 'Amr said,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, used to say:</P>
<P>"The best of you are those who have the most excellent morals."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 61:23.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>2</FONT></B> Abu Hurairah said, A man came to the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and said, O Messenger of All&acirc;h! Who has the greatest right that I should keep company with him with goodness? He</P>
<P>{p. 374}</P>
<P>said, "Thy mother". He said, Who then? He said, "Thy mother." He said, Who then? He said, "Thy mother." He said, Who then? He said, "Then thy father."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:2.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT></B> Mu'&acirc;viyah Ibn J&acirc;himah reported,</P>
<P>J&acirc;himah came to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and said, O Messenger of All&acirc;h! I intended that I should enlist in the fighting force and I have come to consult thee. He said: "Hast thou a mother?" He said, Yes. He said: "Then stick to her, for paradise is beneath her two feet."[1]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(Ns. 25:6.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah said,</P>
<P>A dweller of the desert came to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and said, You</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This had&icirc;th gives the highest place of honour to woman.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 375}</P>
<P>kiss children but we do not kiss them. The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Do I control aught for thee if All&acirc;h has taken away mercy from thy heart?"</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:18.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>5</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah reported,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, took a baby in his arms, rubbing its palate (with chewed date), and it urinated on him, so he sent for water and made it follow the urine.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:21.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>6</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah said,</P>
<P>'A woman came, with her being her two daughters, asking for charity but she did not find with me anything except a date. I gave it to her and she divided it between her two daughters, and did not herself eat of it. Then she got up and went out, and</P>
<P>{p. 376}</P>
<P>the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, entered on us and I informed him about it. So the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Whoever is thrown into a trial on account of these daughters, they are a screen for him from fire."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 24:10.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>7</FONT></B> Anas said, I heard the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, say:</P>
<P>"Whomsoever it pleases that his sustenance should be made ample to him or that his life should be lengthened, let him be kind to his relatives."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 34:11)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>8</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Hurairah reported,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"<I>Rahim</I> is an offshoot of <I>Rahm&acirc;n</I>; so All&acirc;h said, Whoever makes his ties close with thee I will make My ties close with him, and whoever severs his ties</P>
<P>{p. 377}</P>
<P>with thee I will sever My ties with him."[2]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:13.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>9</FONT></B> Abu Hurairah said, The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"The most perfect of the believers in faith is the best of them in moral excellence, and the best of you are the kindest of you to their wives."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(Tr. 10:11)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>10</FONT></B> Aswad said,</P>
<P>I asked '&Acirc;'ishah, What did the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, do when in his house? She said, he served his wife, meaning that he did work for his wife.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 10:44.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[2. The word <I>rahim</I> means the <I>womb</I>, hence <I>relationship by the female side</I>; but it also carries the wider significance of relationship in general; and <I>Rahm&acirc;n</I> means <I>the God of mercy</I> or <I>the Beneficent God</I>. The had&icirc;th signifies that relationship is deeply connected with mercy in its very nature. So whoever makes close ties of relationship by kindness to relatives God is kind to him, and whoever severs the ties of relationship by ill-treatment towards relatives God is displeased with him. One must be kind to relatives though they be non-Muslims (B. 11:7).]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 378}</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>11</FONT></B> Ibn 'Umar reported,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said</P>
<P>"A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim; he does him no injustice, nor does he leave him alone (to be the victim of another's injustice); and whoever does the needful for his brother, All&acirc;h does the needful for him; and whoever removes the distress of a Muslim, All&acirc;h removes from him a distress out of the distresses of the day of resurrection; and whoever covers (the fault of) a Muslim, All&acirc;h will cover his sins on the day of resurrection."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 46:3.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>12</FONT></B> Anas said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said</P>
<P>"Help thy brother whether he is the doer of wrong or wrong is done to him."</P>
<P>They (his companions) said, O Messenger of All&acirc;h! We can help a man to whom wrong is done, but</P>
<P>{p. 379}</P>
<P>how could we help him when he is the doer of wrong? He said: "Take hold of his hands from doing wrong."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 46:4)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>13</FONT></B> Nu'm&acirc;n said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>Thou wilt see the faithful in their having mercy for one another and in their love for one another and in their kindness towards one another like the body; when one member of it ails, the entire body (ails), one part calling out the other with sleeplessness and fever."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:27.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>14</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; M&ucirc;s&acirc; reported,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Believers are in relation to one another as (parts of) a structure, one part of which strengthens the other." And he inserted the fingers of one hand amid those of the other (so as to conjoin his two hands).</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 8:88.)</P>
<P>{p. 380}</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>15</FONT></B> Ibn 'Umar reported,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said, while at Min&acirc;: "Do you know what day is this?" They said, All&acirc;h and His Messenger know best. He said . "This is a sacred day. Do you know what city is this?" They said, All&acirc;h and His Messenger know best. He said, "Sacred city. Do you know what month is this?" They said, All&acirc;h and His Messenger know best. He said: "Sacred month." Then he said: "Surely All&acirc;h has made sacred to you your blood and your property and your honour as this day of yours is sacred in this month of yours in this city of yours."[3]</P>
<P>(B. 25: 132.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[10 These memorable words, making inviolable the blood, property and honour of one Muslim to another, wore uttered on the sacred day of Sacrifices, in the sacred month of Dhu-l-Hijjah, in the sacred city of Makkah.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 381}</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>16</FONT></B> Anas reported,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Do not hate one another and do not be jealous of one another and do not boycott one another, and be servants of All&acirc;h (as) brethren; and it is not lawful for a Muslim that he should sever his relations with his brother for more than three days."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:57.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>17</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Dharr reported,</P>
<P>He heard the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, say:</P>
<P>"A man does not accuse another of being a transgressor, nor does he accuse him of being a k&acirc;fir, but it ( the epithet ) comes back to him, if his companion is not such."[4]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:44.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[4. The Holy Prophet thus emphasized that one member of the Muslim brotherhood should not call another <I>f&acirc;siq</I> (<I>transgressor</I>), or <I>k&acirc;fir</I> (<I>disbeliever</I>). The man who did this deserved to have the very epithet applied to him by way of punishment.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 382}</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>18</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Bakrah said, I heard the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, say:</P>
<P>"When two Muslims meet each other with their swords, both of them are in the fire."</P>
<P>I said, O Messenger of All&acirc;h! This is for the murderer, but what about the one who is murdered? He said:</P>
<P>"He was desirous of murdering his companion."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 2:21.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>19</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Hurairah said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Whoever believes in All&acirc;h and the latter day should not harm his neighbour, and whoever believes in All&acirc;h and the latter day should honour his guest."[5]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:31).</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[5. The sending of gifts to neighbours is recommended (H xxvi:1). <I>Ihr&acirc;m al dzaif</I> (honouring the guest) is specially enjoined on Muslims In another had&icirc;th, {footnote p. 383} it is stated that special food should be prepared for the guest for one day and night--this is called his <I>ja'izah</I>, while entertainment of the guest, his <I>dziy&acirc;fah</I>, lasts for three days. What is spent on the guest after that is termed <I>sadaqah</I> or charity.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 383}</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>20</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah reported,</P>
<P>'The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Gabriel continued to enjoin me with good treatment towards the neighbour until I thought that he would make him heir of the property (of the deceased neighbour.)"</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:28)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>21</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Dharr said,</P>
<P>. . . . The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said to me:</P>
<P>". . . Your slaves are your brethren, All&acirc;h has placed them under your control; so whoever has his brother under his control should feed him from what he eats and should give him clothes to wear from what he wears, and do not impose on them a task which should overpower them, and if you</P>
<P>{p. 384}</P>
<P>impose on them such a task, then help them (in doing it)."[6]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 2:21.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>22</FONT></B> Anas said,</P>
<P>I served the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, for ten years, and he never said to me, Fie. Nor, Why hast thou done (this)? Nor, Why hast thou not done (this)?</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78: 39.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>23</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Hurairah said,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said</P>
<P>"One who manages the affairs of the widow and the poor man is like the one who exerts himself hard in the way of All&acirc;h, or the one who stands up for prayer in the night and fasts in the day."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 69:1.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>24</FONT></B> Sahl ibn Sa'd reported,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and the man who brings up an orphan will</P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 78:24.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>25</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Hurairah reported,</P>
<P>Tufail ibn 'Amr al-Daus&icirc; and his companions came to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and said, O Messenger of All&acirc;h! Daus have disobeyed and refused, so pray to All&acirc;h for their punishment. And it was said, Daus have perished. But he said: "O All&acirc;h! Guide Daus and bring them."[8] (B. 56: 100.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>26</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah reported,</P>
<P>The Jews came to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and said, Death overtake you! '&Acirc;'ishah said, And you, and may All&acirc;h curse you and may All&acirc;h's wrath descend</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[7. The Holy Prophet pointed with his two fingers which are close to each other, meaning that the man who brings up an orphan will be with him in paradise.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>27</FONT></B> Jar&icirc;r said:</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said "All&acirc;h has no mercy on him who is not merciful to men."[10]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B.&amp; M-Msh. 24:15)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>28</FONT></B> Ibn 'Abb&acirc;s said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"He is not of us who does not show mercy to our little ones and respect to our great ones."</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>30</FONT></B> 'Abd All&acirc;h reported,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Surely truth leads to virtue, and virtue leads to paradise, and a man continues to speak the truth until he becomes thoroughly truthful; and surely falsehood leads to vice, and vice leads to the fire, and a man continues to tell lies until he is written down a great liar with All&acirc;h"</P>

<P>{p. 388}</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>31</FONT></B> 'Anas said,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, was not a reviler, nor foul in speech, nor a curser; to reprove one of us he would say: "What is the matter with him may his forehead abound with dust."[11]</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>32</FONT></B> 'Al&icirc; said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"A Muslim owes to a Muslim six (duties) to be bestowed liberally--he should offer him salutation when he meets him,[12] and he should accept when he invites him, and he should pray for him when he sneezes, and he should visit him when he is sick, and he should follow his bier when he dies, and he should love for him what he loves for himself."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(Tr-Msh. 24:l.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[11. The meaning is, may he be frequent in prostrating himself.</P>
<P>12. The words of the Muslim salutation are <I>al-sal&acirc;mu 'alai-kum</I> and the salutation is generally returned by saying <I>wa 'alai-kum-us-sal&acirc;m</I> (peace be with you). To this are sometimes added the words <I>wa rahmat-ull&acirc;hi wa barak&acirc;tuh</I> (<I>and the</I> {footnote p. 389} <I>mercy of All&acirc;h and His blessings</I>).

<P>A man asked the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, what Isl&acirc;m is the best one? He said:</P>
<P>"That thou feed (the poor) and offer salutation to whom thou knowest and whom thou dost not know."</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>35</FONT></B> Qat&acirc;dah said,</P>
<P>I said to Anas, Did the companions of the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, shake hands[13] (when they met)?</P>
<P>He said, Yes.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>36</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah said,</P>
<P>Zaid ibn H&acirc;rithah[11] came to Mad&icirc;nah, and the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, stood up to receive him, and he embraced him[15] and kissed him.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>37</FONT></B> 'Ubaid ibn 'Umair reported,</P>
<P>Ab&ucirc; M&ucirc;s&acirc; al-Ash'ar&icirc; sought permission to see 'Umar and he was not permitted, as if he was engaged, and Abu M&ucirc;s&acirc; came back.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 34:9.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>38</FONT></B> Sa'&icirc;d ibn Abu-l-Hasan said to Hasan,</P>
<P>Women, other than Arabs, keep their bosoms and their heads uncovered. He said, Turn thou away</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[14. 'Zaid was a slave whom the Holy Prophet had set free, and on account of his deep attachment to the Holy Prophet, he was called his son.</P>
<P>15. This is called <I>mu'&acirc;naqah</I> (from <I>'unuq</I> meaning neck). Some had&icirc;th show that the Holy Prophet disallowed it, but he may have done this simply to show that it should not be generally resorted to.]</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>39</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah reported,</P>
<P>Saudah bint Zam'ah went out on a certain night. 'Umar saw her and recognised her and said, By All&acirc;h, O Saudah, thou canst not hide thyself from us. So she returned to the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and mentioned this to him while he was dining in my apartment . . . . . and he said: "It is permitted to you (women) that you go out for your needs."[17]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 67:116.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[16. This incident relates to the time when the whole of Arabia had become Muslim. Arab women also kept their heads and bosoms uncovered before Isl&acirc;m. Hence the Holy Qur'&acirc;n ordered women to wear their head-coverings over their bosoms (24: 31).</P>
<P>17. We find women in the Holy Prophet's time repairing unveiled to mosques to join the congregational prayers (B. 10:162), carrying provisions for soldiers (B. 56:66), taking care of the sick and the wounded (B. 56:67), taking part in actual fighting when necessary (B. 56:62), helping their husbands in the labour of the field (B. 67:108), serving the male guests at a feast (B. 67:78), carrying on business (B. 1154) carrying on trade with men (B. 34:67), and so on.]</P>

<P>Asm&acirc;', daughter of Abu Bakr, came to the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and she was wearing thin clothes. The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, turned away his face from her and said:</P>
<P>"O Asm&acirc;'! When the woman attains her majority, it is not proper that any part of her body should be seen except this and this."</P>
<P>And he pointed to his face and his hands."[18]</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[18. A woman is not required to cover her face or wear a veil. In fact, in pilgrimage she is required to keep herself unveiled (B. 25:23), because the veil was worn as a mark of rank, and was not required by the law of Isl&acirc;m.]</P>
