<P>1. "And thy Lord do magnify, And thy garments do purify, And uncleanness do shun" (74:3-5).</P>
<P>2. "Surely All&acirc;h loves those who turn to Him again and again, and He loves those who purify themselves" (2:222).</P>
<P>3. "Attend to your adornment at every time of prayer." (7:31).</P>
<P>4. "O you who believe! When you rise up to prayers, wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows and wipe our hands and (wash) your feet to the ankles; and if you are under an obligation to perform a total ablution, have a bath; and if you are sick or on a journey, or one of you come from the privy, or you have had contact with women, and you cannot find water, betake yourselves to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith; All&acirc;h does not desire to put on you any difficulty but He wishes to purify you and that He may complete His favour to you, so that you may be thankful" (5:6).</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Purification, though a necessary preliminary to prayer, is an independent subject and is dealt with as such in Had&icirc;th collections. The first three quotations from the Holy Qur'&acirc;n given above require in general terms that the man who would turn to his Lord should be pure in body and garments. The Purification of the body is thus made a preliminary to prayer so that by external purification a man's attention may be directed to the purification of the soul which is aimed at in prayer. V. 4 gives the details of ablutions which are necessary before prayer. Purity of the body is thus required as a preliminary to the purity of mind, and the Muslim who is required to say prayers five times a day must needs keep himself and his clothes always clean.</P>
<P>It is true that an intelligent man should know for himself what cleanliness is, but religion aims at giving directions to men in all stages of civilization, in early states as well as in the more developed ones. Moreover. the masses among all people stand in need of minute details, and hence while the Holy Qur'&acirc;n simply gives the general direction to keep oneself in a state of cleanliness, Had&icirc;th gives the necessary details. As a matter of fact Isl&acirc;m directs attention to many details of personal cleanliness of which even the more civilized people are ignorant.</P>
<P>{p. 41}</P>
<P>I have divided the chapter into five sections. The first deals with natural evacuations. Purification is called half the faith (h. 1) and the key to prayer (hh. 2. 3), It must not be forgotten that purity of the body is a prelude to the purity of the soul (h. 4). Full regard must be paid to personal cleanliness as well as public hygiene (hh. 5-13). Spitting in public places is forbidden (hh. 16, 17).</P>
<P>The second section deals with tooth-brushing which occupies a very prominent place in the Muslim's cleanliness. It is spoken of as a means of purifying the mouth and seeking the pleasure of the Lord (h. 18), which is to show that God loves even bodily cleanliness. Great stress is laid upon its use (hh. 19, 20), and the minimum requirement is that the tooth-brush should be used after getting up from sleep (hh. 21, 22), A clean mouth is in fact the greatest help for the preservation of health. Its importance is further emphasized in h. 23, The third section gives the details of ablution (hh. 25 36) and shows when a fresh ablution becomes necessary (hh. 37-41). A prayer directing attention to purity of the spirit must be offered when the ablution has been performed (h. 43).</P>
<P>The fourth section deals with total ablution or bath, which is made compulsory once a week (hh. 44-46). Particular occasions on which bath must be taken are mentioned in hh. 47-50, A person under an obligation to have a bath on account of <I>jan&acirc;bah</I> and a menstruating woman are not impure (hh. 51, 52). Some details are given in hh. 53, 54, and taking a bath naked in an open place is strictly forbidden (1.1. 55).</P>
<P>The fifth section deals with <I>tayammum</I> or wiping the face and hands with pure dust when water is not available for ablution or bath, though it may be available for drinking or domestic purposes, or when the use of water is likely to be harmful (hh. 56-58). This act is as it were a reminder that purification before prayer is an essential thing.</P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(Ah-Msh. 1)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>3</FONT></B> Ibn 'Umar said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Prayer is not accepted without purification, nor (is) charity (accepted) out of what is acquired by unlawful means."[2]</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>4</FONT></B> Anas said,</P>

<P>"O All&acirc;h! I seek refuge</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[2. This had&icirc;th and the previous one lay down in general terms that purification is a necessary condition of prayer, which in fact means that a man should always keep himself free from impurities, since prayer is said five times a day. The habit of outward purification is thus developed through an institution which is meant to purify the soul, and a Muslim is required to keep his body, his clothes, in fact, the whole of his environment, clean. Charity like prayer purifies the mind, and as what is acquired by unlawful means is impure, the pure and the impure cannot go together.]</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>5</FONT></B> Anas reported,</P>
<P>When the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, went out for natural evacuation, I and a boy used to go and with us there used to be a bucket of water.[4]</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>6</FONT></B> 'Abd All&acirc;h said,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, went to ease himself and he asked me to bring him three pebbles.[5]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 4:21.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>7</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[3. <I>Khubuth</I> is the plural of <I>khab&icirc;th</I> (an evil person) and <I>khab&acirc;'ith</I> is the plural of <I>khab&icirc;thah</I> (an evil person of feminine gender), and the words are generally understood as meaning the devils, but according to the <I>Nih&acirc;yah</I>, the first word may also be read as <I>khubth</I> which means impure deeds and the second word may also mean evil habits. Thus from outward defilement attention is directed to inward impurities.</P>
<P>4. Other had&icirc;th speak of stones for cleaning purposes, but water was used when available even after cleaning with earth or stones. These may appear to be minor details, but the minutest details are necessary to develop habits of cleanliness. Water or earth was also used after urinating.</P>
<P>5. This with and the one following speak of pebbles or balls of dry earth for cleaning purposes. Toilet paper would serve the same purpose.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 44}</P>
<P>"When one of you goes to ease himself, let him take with him three pebbles with which to clean himself, for these will suffice him."</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>8</FONT></B> J&acirc;bir said,</P>
<P>When the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, wanted to ease himself he went (to a distant place) until no one could see him.[6]</P>

<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>When one of you wishes to pass urine, let him seek the proper place for urinating."[7]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(AD-Msh. 3:2.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[6. For evacuating himself a man must not, therefore, sit in a place where he can be seen by others; <I>i.e.</I>, when he goes out into fields. Latrines must be made on the same principle.</P>

<P>'The right hand of the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, was for his ablution and his food, and his left hand for cleaning after easing himself and for removing noxious things.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>11</FONT></B> Mu'&acirc;dh said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>

<P>When the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, went to the privy, I brought to him water in a small vessel or in a leather bag and he used water for cleaning, then rubbed his hand on the ground,[10] then I brought to him another vessel of water and he made ablution.</P>

<P>When the Prophet,</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[9. To urinate in a standing posture is therefore not prohibited.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>17</FONT></B> Anas reported that The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, saw phlegm on the front (wall of the mosque) and it was painful to him to such a degree that (signs of) it could be seen in his face. . .</P>
<P>Then he took hold of a corner of his sheet and spat in it then turned one part of it over the other and said:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[11. Evidently it was a public place where other people were present and by spitting in his handkerchief he showed that it was not proper to spit on the ground in public places. Besides being indecent, it is insanitary.]</P>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 30:27.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>19</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Hurairah said, on the authority of the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, "Were it not that I would place too heavy a burden on my community, I would have commanded them to use the tooth-brush at every ablution."</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>21</FONT></B> Hudhaifah said,</P>
<P>When the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, got up during the night (for tahajjud), he used to clean his mouth with the tooth-brush.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 4:73)</P>

<P>'Never did the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, wake up after sleeping at night or in the day, but he used the tooth-brush before he performed ablution."[14]</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">SECTION 3.--ABLUTION OR WUDZ&Ucirc;'</H2>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>24</FONT></B> Sa'&icirc;d ibn Zaid said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"That man has not performed ablution who does not remember All&acirc;h in doing it."[15]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(Tr-Msh. 3:4.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>25</FONT></B> Yahy&acirc; al-M&acirc;zin&icirc; reported that</P>
<P>A man said to 'Abd All&acirc;h ibn Zaid, Canst thou show me how the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, performed ablution? 'Abd All&acirc;h ibn Zaid said, Yes.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[15. Ablution, which means washing of certain parts of the body that are generally exposed and where dust or dirt is likely to settle, is a preparation for going into Divine presence. The object is undoubtedly twofold, that a man should be clean and that he should feel that he stands in need of the purification of the soul as he stands in need of the cleaning of the body. The remembrance of All&acirc;h is needed to direct attention to this. The beginning should be made with <I>Bismill&acirc;h</I> as in the case of all important affairs, while h. 42. speaks of the prayer when the ablution ends.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 51}</P>
<P>So he sent for water and poured it over his hands and washed his hands twice, then he rinsed his mouth and sniffed water into his nose thrice, then he washed his face thrice, then he washed his hands up to the elbow twice, then he wiped his head with both his hands so that he carried them from the front and brought them back he began with his forehead until he carried them to his neck, then he brought them back to the place from which he had started then he washed his two feet.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 4:38.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>26</FONT></B> Ibn 'Abb&acirc;s said,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, performed ablution (washing each part) once only.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 4:22.)</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>28</FONT></B> It is reported about 'Uthm&acirc;n that</P>
<P>He performed ablution at Maq&acirc;'id, and said, May I not show you the ablution of the Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>? Then he performed ablution (washing each part) thrice.[16]</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(M-Msh. 3:44)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>29</FONT></B> '&Acirc;'ishah said,</P>
<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, was fond of beginning on the right side, in putting on his shoes and in combing his hair and in performing his ablution, (in fact) in all his actions.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 4:31.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[16. The various reports show that there was great latitude in these matters. The cleaning might be effected in some cases by washing once only while in others it might require repetition. Maq&acirc;'id, according to Ibn Hajar, is the name of a place in Mad&icirc;nah. According to others, it means a place where people sit together.]</P>

The next had&icirc;th shows that socks are treated similarly, <I>i.e.</I>, it is sufficient to pass wet hands over them when they are worn after performing ablution. This may be done for one day and night, i.e., the socks or boots must bc taken off and the feet washed once in every twenty-four hours, but in the case of one who is journeying the time-limit is three days and nights.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>36</FONT></B> Ab&ucirc; Hurairah said,</P>
<P>The Messenger of All&acirc;h, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, said:</P>
<P>"Prayer is not accepted of a man who voids himself[20] until he performs ablution."</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 4:2.)</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[20. The Arabic word is <I>ahdatha</I> which means originally <I>he caused</I> or <I>occasioned a thing</I>, and is technically applied to the <I>voiding of ordure</I>. When Ab&ucirc; Hurairah was asked, what <I>hadath</I> was, he simply said, <I>breaking wind</I> but it includes the passing of urine, stools and wind. To this must be added sound sleep as stated in h. 39 and vomiting (h.40), though there is a difference of opinion in the latter case. The reason for a fresh ablution after sound sleep seems to be that one does not know if one has passed wind in that condition. Bukh&acirc;r&icirc; makes it clear that ablution is only necessary when something passes out through the <I>makhrajain</I>, the two ways of natural evacuation. The flowing of blood from wounds or the spitting of blood does not necessitate ablution. If a man performs ablution by wiping his boots or socks, and then takes them off, fresh ablution is not necessary (hh, 32, 34). Taking food or milk does not call for fresh ablution. but the mouth should be rinsed in both cases. (B. 4:50, 51, 52.)</P>
<P>There are certain had&icirc;th speaking of the necessity of ablution in certain other cases. For instance, there is a had&icirc;th which says that ablution should be performed if one has kissed one's wife, but this is contradicted by other had&icirc;th. The clear rule laid down by Bukh&acirc;r&icirc; that ablution is necessitated only by what passes out of the two outlets of natural evacuation is the safest rule. Sound sleep and vomiting are the only exceptions.]</P>

<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT> , used to perform ablution at every prayer. I (his disciple) said, How did you act? He said, Ablution sufficed one of us until he voided himself.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">(B. 4:55.)</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>38</FONT></B> Anas said,</P>
<P>The companions of the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, used to wait for the night (<I>'Ish&acirc;'</I>) prayer until their heads nodded (in drowsiness), then they said their prayers and did not perform ablution.</P>

It does not mean that a Muslim should take a bath only once a week; it is the minimum requirement, and the whole body as well as the head must be washed by both men and women, rich and poor, at least once a week. To keep oneself clean has already been stated to be half the faith, and in the hot and even temperate seasons nothing less than a daily bath can serve that purpose, but in the cold season and in the case of generality of people who cannot afford a daily bath, the washing of the whole body once a week is an absolute necessity.]</P>

<P>The Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, commanded the taking of a bath on four occasions: on account of <I>jan&acirc;bah</I>,[24] and on Friday, and in case of cupping, and after washing a dead body.</P>

<P>24. Jan&acirc;bah (from <I>janb</I> meaning a <I>side</I>) is literally the <I>putting of a thing aside</I> or <I>making a person avoid a thing</I>. In the religious terminology of Isl&acirc;m, the state of Jan&acirc;bah arises from nocturnal pollution (<I>ihtil&acirc;m</I>) and <I>coitus</I> (sexual intercourse) for both men and women. There are contradictory had&icirc;th as to whether bath is necessary in case of sexual intercourse when there is no emission, and Bukh&acirc;r&icirc; favours the view that <I>wudz&ucirc;'</I> or ablution is sufficient in such a case, but that bath is better.

Considering myself unclean I left him, then I went and took a bath. Then he (Abu Hurairah) came, and (the Prophet) said, "Where wast thou, O Abu Hurairah?"

Menstruation generally lasts from three to ten days, and a bath is needed when the flow stops, after a minimum period of three days. Bath must necessarily be taken after the maximum period of ten days, and if the flow continues after that, it is called <I>istih&acirc;dzah</I>, and the rules relating to menses do not apply to this state.]</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>51</FONT></B> Anas said,</P>
<P>When a woman among the Jews had her menses, they would not eat with her and would not be with her in the same room; so the companions of the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, asked the Prophet, <FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=GREEN>peace and blessings of All&acirc;h be on him</FONT>, and All&acirc;h revealed to him, "They ask thee about the menses."

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[26. This had&icirc;th shows that the state of <I>jan&acirc;bah</I> is not a state of defilement. The <I>junub</I> can do everything; he is simply required to take a bath before saying his prayers.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=GREEN>57</FONT></B> It is related that 'Amr ibn al-'&Acirc;s became a <I>junub</I> on a cold night, so he resorted to <I>tayammum</I> and recited the verse, "Do not kill yourselves, for All&acirc;h is Merciful to you" (4: 29).

There are other had&icirc;th which give a slightly different process. but as the object is simply to remind a man that he is going to a Higher Presence. this simple process serves the purpose well enough. Bukh&acirc;r&icirc; relates that Yahy&acirc; ibn Sa'&icirc;d said that there was no harm in performing <I>tayammum</I> on sabkhah, <I>i.e.</I>, on ground on the surface of which salt had appeared (B. 7:6) And generally anything would do, or, the surface of which dust might have settled.</P>
