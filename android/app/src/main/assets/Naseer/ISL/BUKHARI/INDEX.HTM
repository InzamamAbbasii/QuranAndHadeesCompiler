<P>
The Hadith are anecdotes about Muhammad and other founders of Islam.
They are considered important source material
about religious practice, law, and historical traditions.
This is an extensive collection of Hadith as organized by 
Muhammad Ism&acirc;'&icirc;l al-Bukh&acirc;r&icirc;, one of the
most respected of the Hadith redactors.</P>

<I>Production Notes</I>:
This hypertext was generated from a text file found at a 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.caltech.edu/pub/calmsa/Hadith/">Caltech FTP site</A>,
dated 1993.
The translator of the source text of
this etext (and its copyright status)
is unknown, and any information about this would be greatly appreciated.
It may be the edition of Muhammad Asad, mentioned in the preface to 
<A HREF="../hadith/index.htm">A Manual of Hadith</A>, but we don't know.
There are also some occasional (and very obvious) minor gaps and errors
in this etext, which we haven't attempted to correct, since we
don't have the source book.
