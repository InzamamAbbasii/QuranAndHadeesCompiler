O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His  messenger, and keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet,  nor shout when speaking to him as ye shout one to another, lest your works be  rendered vain while ye perceive not. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
Lo! they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah,  those are they whose hearts Allah hath proven unto righteousness. Theirs will be  forgiveness and immense reward. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartments, most of them  have no sense. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
And if they had had patience till thou camest forth unto them, it had been  better for them. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
O ye who believe! If an evil-liver bring you tidings, verify it, lest ye smite  some folk in ignorance and afterward repent of what ye did. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
And know that the messenger of Allah is among you. If he were to obey you  in much of the government, ye would surely be in trouble; but Allah hath endeared  the faith to you and hath beautified it in your hearts, and hath made disbelief and  lewdness and rebellion hateful unto you. Such are they who are the rightly guided. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
(It is) a bounty and a grace from Allah; and Allah is Knower, Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
And if two parties of believers fall to fighting, then make peace between  them. And if one party of them doeth wrong to the other, fight ye that which doeth  wrong till it return unto the ordinance of Allah; then, if it return, make peace between  them justly, and act equitably. Lo! Allah loveth the equitable. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
The believers are naught else than brothers. Therefore make peace between  your brethren and observe your duty to Allah that haply ye may obtain mercy. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
O ye who believe! Let not a folk deride a folk who may be better than they  (are), not let women (deride) women who may be better than they are; neither defame  one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. Bad is the name of lewdness after  faith. And whoso turneth not in repentance, such are evil-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
O ye who believe! Shun much suspicion; for lo! some suspicion is a crime.  And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you love to eat the flesh of  his dead brother ? Ye abhor that (so abhor the other)! And keep your duty (to Allah).  Lo! Allah is Relenting, Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
O mankind! Lo! We have created you male and female, and have made you  nations and tribes that ye may know one another. Lo! the noblest of you, in the sight  of Allah, is the best in conduct. Lo! Allah is Knower, Aware. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
The wandering Arabs say: We believe. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Ye  believe not, but rather say "We submit," for the faith hath not yet entered into your  hearts. Yet, if ye obey Allah and His messenger, He will not withhold from you aught  of (the reward of) your deeds. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
The (true) believers are those only who believe in Allah and His messenger  and afterward doubt not, but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of  Allah. Such are the sincere. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Would ye teach Allah your religion, when  Allah knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and Allah is Aware  of all things ? </P>
<P><A NAME="049_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
They make it a favour unto thee (Muhammad) that they have surrendered  (unto Him). Say: Deem not your Surrender a favour unto me; but Allah doth confer a  favour on you, inasmuch as He hath led you to the Faith, if ye are earnest. </P>
<P><A NAME="049_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
Lo! Allah knoweth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is  Seer of what ye do. <HR>
