<P><A NAME="015_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Scripture and a plain Reading. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
It may be that those who disbelieve wish ardently that they were Muslims. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
Let them eat and enjoy life, and let (false) hope beguile them. They will  come to know! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And We destroyed no township but there was a known decree for it. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
No nation can outstrip its term nor can they lag behind. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
And they say: O thou unto whom the Reminder is revealed, lo! thou art  indeed a madman! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
Why bringest thou not angels unto us, if thou art of the truthful ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
We send not down the angels save with the Fact, and in that case (the  disbelievers) would not be tolerated. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Lo! We, even We, reveal the Reminder, and lo! We verily are its Guardian. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
We verily sent (messengers) before thee among the factions of the men of  old. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
And never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty: </P>
<P><A NAME="015_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
They believe not therein, though the example of the men of old hath gone  before. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
And even if We opened unto them a gate of heaven and they kept mounting  through it, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
They would say: Our sight is wrong - nay, but we are folk bewitched. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
And verily in the heaven we have set mansions of the stars, and We have  beautified it for beholders. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And We have guarded it from every outcast devil, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
Save him who stealeth the hearing, and them doth a clear flame pursue. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And the earth have We spread out, and placed therein firm hills, and caused  each seemly thing to grow therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And we have given unto you livelihoods therein, and unto those for whom ye  provide not. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And there is not a thing but with Us are the stores thereof. And we send it not  down save in appointed measure. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And We send the winds fertilising, and cause water to descend from the sky,  and give it you to drink. It is not ye who are the holders of the store thereof. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
Lo! and it is We, even We, Who quicken and give death, and We are the  Inheritor. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
And verily We know the eager among you and verily We know the laggards. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
Lo! thy Lord will gather them together. Lo! He is Wise, Aware. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
Verily We created man of potter's clay of black mud altered, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
And the jinn did We create aforetime of essential fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
And (remember) when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am creating a  mortal out of potter's clay of black mud altered, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
So, when I have made him and have breathed into him of My Spirit, do ye  fall down, prostrating yourselves unto him. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
So the angels fell prostrate, all of them together </P>
<P><A NAME="015_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
Save Iblis. He refused to be among the prostrate. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
He said: O Iblis! What aileth thee that thou art not among the prostrate ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
He said: I am not one to prostrate myself unto a mortal whom Thou hast  created out of potter's clay of black mud altered! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
He said: Then go thou forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
And lo! the curse shall be upon thee till the Day of Judgment. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
He said: Then lo! thou art of those reprieved </P>
<P><A NAME="015_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
Till the Day of appointed time. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Because Thou hast sent me astray, I verily shall adorn the  path of error for them in the earth, and shall mislead them every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
Save such of them as are Thy perfectly devoted slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
He said: This is a right course incumbent upon Me: </P>
<P><A NAME="015_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Lo! as for My slaves, thou hast no power over any of them save such of the  froward as follow thee, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
And lo! for all such, hell will be the promised place. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
It hath seven gates, and each gate hath an appointed portion. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
Lo! those who ward off (evil) are among gardens and watersprings. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
(And it is said unto them): Enter them in peace, secure. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
And We remove whatever rancour may be in their breasts. As brethren, face  to face, (they rest) on couches raised. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
Toil cometh not unto them there, nor will they be expelled from thence. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
Announce, (O Muhammad) unto My slaves that verily I am the Forgiving,  the Merciful, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
And that My doom is the dolorous doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And tell them of Abraham's guests, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
(How) when they came in unto him, and said: Peace. He said: Lo! we are  afraid of you. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
They said: Be not afraid! Lo! we bring thee good tidings of a boy possessing  wisdom. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
He said: Bring ye me good tidings (of a son) when old age hath overtaken me  ? Of what then can ye bring good tidings ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
They said: We bring thee good tidings in truth. So be not thou of the  despairing. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
He said: And who despaireth of the mercy of his Lord save those who are  astray ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
He said: And afterward what is your business, O ye messengers (of Allah) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
They said: We have been sent unto a guilty folk, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
(All) save the family of Lot. Them we shall deliver every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
Except his wife, of whom We had decreed that she should be of those who  stay behind. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
And when the messengers came unto the family of Lot, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
He said: Lo! ye are folk unknown (to me). </P>
<P><A NAME="015_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
They said: Nay, but we bring thee that concerning which they keep  disputing, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
And bring thee the Truth, and lo! we are truth-tellers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
So travel with thy household in a portion of the night, and follow thou their  backs. Let none of you turn round, but go whither ye are commanded. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
And We made plain the case to him, that the root of them (who did wrong)  was to be cut at early morn. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
And the people of the city came, rejoicing at the news (of new arrivals). </P>
<P><A NAME="015_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
He said: Lo! they are my guests. Affront me not! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
And keep your duty to Allah, and shame me not! </P>
<P><A NAME="015_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
They said; Have we not forbidden you from (entertaining) anyone ? </P>
<P><A NAME="015_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
He said: Here are my daughters, if ye must be doing (so). </P>
<P><A NAME="015_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
By thy life (O Muhammad) they moved blindly in the frenzy of approaching  death. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
Then the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the sunrise. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
And We utterly confounded them, and We rained upon them stones of heated  clay. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
Lo! therein verily are portents for those who read the signs. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
And lo! it is upon a road still uneffaced. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
Lo! therein is indeed a portent for believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
And the dwellers in the wood indeed were evil-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
So we took vengeance on them; and lo! they both are on a high-road plain to  see. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
And the dwellers in Al-Hijr denied (Our) messengers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
And we gave them Our revelations, but they were averse to them. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
And they used to hew out dwellings from the hills, (wherein they dwelt)  secure. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
But the (Awful) Cry overtook them at the morning hour, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
And that which they were wont to count as gain availed them not. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save  with truth, and lo! the Hour is surely coming. So forgive, (O Muhammad), with a  gracious forgiveness. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
Lo! Thy Lord! He is the All-Wise Creator. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_087"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT>
We have given thee seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the great Qur'an. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_088"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT>
Strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among  them to enjoin, and be not grieved on their account, and lower thy wing (in  tenderness) for the believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_089"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT>
And say: Lo! I, even I, am a plain warner, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_090"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT>
Such as We send down for those who make division, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_091"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">91</FONT>
Those who break the Qur'an into parts. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_092"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">92</FONT>
Them, by thy Lord, We shall question, every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_093"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">93</FONT>
Of what they used to do. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_094"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">94</FONT>
So proclaim that which thou art commanded, and withdraw from the  idolaters. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_095"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">95</FONT>
Lo! We defend thee from the scoffers, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_096"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">96</FONT>
Who set some other god along with Allah. But they will come to know. </P>
<P><A NAME="015_097"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">97</FONT>
Well know We that thy bosom is oppressed by what they say, </P>
<P><A NAME="015_098"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">98</FONT>
But hymn the praise of thy Lord, and be of those who make prostration (unto  Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="015_099"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">99</FONT>
And serve thy Lord till the Inevitable cometh unto thee. <HR>
