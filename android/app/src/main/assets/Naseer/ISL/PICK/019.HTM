<P><A NAME="019_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Kaf. Ha. Ya. A'in. Sad. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
A mention of the mercy of thy Lord unto His servant Zachariah. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
When he cried unto his Lord a cry in secret, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
Saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining  with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Lo! I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren. Oh, give me from  Thy presence a successor </P>
<P><A NAME="019_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Who shall inherit of me and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob. And make  him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
(It was said unto him): O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son  whose name is John; we have given the same name to none before (him). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have  reached infirm old age ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me, even as I created  thee before, when thou wast naught. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Appoint for me some token. He said: Thy token is that  thou, with no bodily defect, shalt not speak unto mankind three nights. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary, and signified to  them: Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
(And it was said unto his son): O John! Hold fast the Scripture. And we gave  him wisdom when a child, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And compassion from Our presence, and purity; and he was devout, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
And dutiful toward his parents. And he was not arrogant, rebellious. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
Peace on him the day he was born, and the day he dieth and the day he shall  be raised alive! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
And make mention of Mary in the Scripture, when she had withdrawn from  her people to a chamber looking East, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit and  it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
She said: Lo! I seek refuge in the Beneficent One from thee, if thou art God- fearing. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a  faultless son. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
She said: How can I have a son when no mortal hath touched me, neither  have I been unchaste ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be)  that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a  thing ordained. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
And the pangs of childbirth drove her unto the trunk of the palm-tree. She  said: Oh, would that I had died ere this and had become a thing of naught, forgotten! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
Then (one) cried unto her from below her, saying: Grieve not! Thy Lord hath  placed a rivulet beneath thee, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
And shake the trunk of the palm-tree toward thee, thou wilt cause ripe dates  to fall upon thee. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I  have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
Then she brought him to her own folk, carrying him. They said: O Mary!  Thou hast come with an amazing thing. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a  harlot. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is in the  cradle, a young boy ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
He spake: Lo! I am the slave of Allah. He hath given me the Scripture and  hath appointed me a Prophet, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
And hath made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and hath enjoined upon  me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And (hath made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me  arrogant, unblest. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be  raised alive! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning  which they doubt. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
It befitteth not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should take unto Himself a son.  Glory be to Him! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
And lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So serve Him. That is the right  path. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
The sects among them differ: but woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting  of an awful Day. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
See and hear them on the Day they come unto Us! yet the evil-doers are to- day in error manifest. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
And warn them of the Day of anguish when the case hath been decided. Now  they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
Lo! We, only We, inherit the earth and all who are thereon, and unto Us they  are returned. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
And make mention (O Muhammad) in the Scripture of Abraham. Lo! he was  a saint, a prophet. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
When he said unto his father: O my father! Why worshippest thou that which  heareth not nor seeth, nor can in aught avail thee ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
O my father! Lo! there hath come unto me of knowledge that which came  not unto thee. So follow me, and I will lead thee on a right path. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
O my father! Serve not the devil. Lo! the devil is a rebel unto the Beneficent. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
O my father! Lo! I fear lest a punishment from the Beneficent overtake thee  so that thou become a comrade of the devil. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
He said: Rejectest thou my gods, O Abraham ? If thou cease not, I shall  surely stone thee. Depart from me a long while! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
He said: Peace be unto thee! I shall ask forgiveness of my Lord for thee. Lo!  He was ever gracious unto me. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside Allah, and I  shall pray unto my Lord. It may be that, in prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be  unblest. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
So, when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were  worshipping beside Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a  prophet. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
And we gave them of Our mercy, and assigned to them a high and true  renown. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And make mention in the Scripture of Moses. Lo! he was chosen, and he was  a messenger (of Allah), a prophet. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
We called him from the right slope of the Mount, and brought him nigh in  communion. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
And We bestowed upon him of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet  (likewise). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
And make mention in the Scripture of Ishmael. Lo! he was a keeper of his  promise, and he was a messenger (of Allah), a prophet. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
He enjoined upon his people worship and almsgiving, and was acceptable in  the sight of his Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
And make mention in the Scripture of Idris. Lo! he was a saint, a prophet; </P>
<P><A NAME="019_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
And We raised him to high station. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
These are they unto whom Allah showed favour from among the prophets, of  the seed of Adam and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Noah, and of the  seed of Abraham and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose.  When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down,  adoring and weeping. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined  worship and have followed lusts. But they will meet deception. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
Save him who shall repent and believe and do right. Such will enter the  Garden, and they will not be wronged in aught - </P>
<P><A NAME="019_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
Gardens of Eden, which the Beneficent hath promised to His slaves in the  unseen. Lo! His promise is ever sure of fulfilment - </P>
<P><A NAME="019_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
They hear therein no idle talk, but only Peace; and therein they have food for  morn and evening. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
Such is the Garden which We cause the devout among Our bondmen to  inherit. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord. Unto Him  belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those  two, and thy Lord was never forgetful - </P>
<P><A NAME="019_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them! Therefor,  worship thou Him and be thou steadfast in His service. Knowest thou one that can be  named along with Him ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
And man saith: When I am dead, shall I forsooth be brought forth alive ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
Doth not man remember that We created him before, when he was naught ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
And, by thy Lord, verily We shall assemble them and the devils, then We  shall bring them, crouching, around hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
Then We shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most  stubborn in rebellion to the Beneficent. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
And surely We are Best Aware of those most worthy to be burned therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
There is not one of you but shall approach it. That is a fixed ordinance of thy  Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil, and leave the evil-doers  crouching there. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve  say unto those who believe: Which of the two parties (yours or ours) is better in  position, and more imposing as an army ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who were more  imposing in respect of gear and outward seeming! </P>
<P><A NAME="019_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will verily prolong his span  of life until, when they behold that which they were promised, whether it be  punishment (in the world), or the Hour (of doom), they will know who is worse in  position and who is weaker as an army. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
Allah increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright, and the good deeds  which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better for resort. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith: Assuredly  I shall be given wealth and children ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
Hath he perused the Unseen, or hath he made a pact with the Beneficent ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
Nay, but We shall record that which he saith and prolong for him a span of  torment. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
And We shall inherit from him that whereof he spake, and he will come unto  Us, alone (without his wealth and children). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
And they have chosen (other) gods beside Allah that they may be a power for  them. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto  them. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound  them with confusion ? </P>
<P><A NAME="019_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
So make no haste against them (O Muhammad). We do but number unto  them a sum (of days). </P>
<P><A NAME="019_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly  company. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_087"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT>
They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a  covenant with his Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_088"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT>
And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_089"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT>
Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing </P>
<P><A NAME="019_090"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT>
Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the  mountains fall in ruins, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_091"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">91</FONT>
That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son, </P>
<P><A NAME="019_092"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">92</FONT>
When it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should  choose a son. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_093"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">93</FONT>
There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as  a slave. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_094"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">94</FONT>
Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with (right) numbering. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_095"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">95</FONT>
And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection,  alone. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_096"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">96</FONT>
Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for  them love. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_097"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">97</FONT>
And We make (this Scripture) easy in thy tongue, (O Muhammad) only that  thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off (evil), and warn  therewith the froward folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="019_098"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">98</FONT>
And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou  (Muhammad) see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound ? <HR>
