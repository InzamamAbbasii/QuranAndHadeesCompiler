<P><A NAME="037_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
By those who set the ranks in battle order </P>
<P><A NAME="037_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
And those who drive away (the wicked) with reproof </P>
<P><A NAME="037_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
And those who read (the Word) for a reminder, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
Lo! thy Lord is surely One; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Lord of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them, and Lord  of the sun's risings. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Lo! We have adorned the lowest heaven with an ornament, the planets; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
With security from every froward devil. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
They cannot listen to the Highest Chiefs for they are pelted from every side, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Outcast, and theirs is a perpetual torment; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Save him who snatcheth a fragment, and there pursueth him a piercing flame. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Then ask them (O Muhammad): Are they stronger as a creation, or those  (others) whom we have created ? Lo! We created them of plastic clay. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
Nay, but thou dost marvel when they mock </P>
<P><A NAME="037_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And heed not when they are reminded, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
And seek to scoff when they behold a portent. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
And they say: Lo! this is mere magic; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth,  be raised (again) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And our forefathers ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
Say (O Muhammad): Ye, in truth; and ye will be brought low. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
There is but one Shout, and lo! they behold, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And say: Ah, woe for us! This is the Day of Judgment. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
This is the Day of Separation, which ye used to deny. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
(And it is said unto the angels): Assemble those who did wrong, together  with their wives and what they used to worship </P>
<P><A NAME="037_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
Instead of Allah, and lead them to the path to hell; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
And stop them, for they must be questioned. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
What aileth you that ye help not one another ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
Nay, but this day they make full submission. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
They say: Lo! ye used to come unto us, imposing, (swearing that ye spoke  the truth). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
They answer: Nay, but ye (yourselves) were not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
We had no power over you, but ye were wayward folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
Now the Word of our Lord hath been fulfilled concerning us. Lo! we are  about to taste (the doom). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
Thus we misled you. Lo! we were (ourselves) astray. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
Then lo! this day they (both) are sharers in the doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
Lo! thus deal We with the guilty. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
For when it was said unto them, There is no God save Allah, they were  scornful </P>
<P><A NAME="037_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
And said: Shall we forsake our gods for a mad poet ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
Nay, but he brought the Truth, and he confirmed those sent (before him). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
Lo! (now) verily ye taste the painful doom - </P>
<P><A NAME="037_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
Ye are requited naught save what ye did - </P>
<P><A NAME="037_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
Save single-minded slaves of Allah; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
For them there is a known provision, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Fruits. And they will be honoured </P>
<P><A NAME="037_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
In the Gardens of delight, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
On couches facing one another; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
A cup from a gushing spring is brought round for them, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
White, delicious to the drinkers, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
Wherein there is no headache nor are they made mad thereby. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
And with them are those of modest gaze, with lovely eyes, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
(Pure) as they were hidden eggs (of the ostrich). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
And some of them draw near unto others, mutually questioning. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
A speaker of them saith: Lo! I had a comrade </P>
<P><A NAME="037_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
Who used to say: Art thou in truth of those who put faith (in his words) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
Can we, when we are dead and have become mere dust and bones - can we  (then) verily be brought to book ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
He saith: Will ye look ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
Then looketh he and seeth him in the depth of hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
He saith: By Allah, thou verily didst all but cause my ruin, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
And had it not been for the favour of my Lord, I too had been of those haled  forth (to doom). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
Are we then not to die </P>
<P><A NAME="037_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
Saving our former death, and are we not to be punished ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
Lo! this is the supreme triumph. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
For the like of this, then, let the workers work. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
Is this better as a welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
Lo! We have appointed it a torment for wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
Lo! it is a tree that springeth in the heart of hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
Its crop is as it were the heads of devils </P>
<P><A NAME="037_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
And lo! they verily must eat thereof, and fill (their) bellies therewith. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
And afterward, lo! thereupon they have a drink of boiling water </P>
<P><A NAME="037_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
And afterward, lo! their return is surely unto hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
They indeed found their fathers astray, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
But they make haste (to follow) in their footsteps. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
And verily most of the men of old went astray before them, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
And verily We sent among them warners. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
Then see the nature of the consequence for those warned, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
Save single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
And Noah verily prayed unto Us, and gracious was the Hearer of his prayer </P>
<P><A NAME="037_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
And We saved him and his household from the great distress, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
And made his seed the survivors, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
And left for him among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<P><A NAME="037_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
Peace be unto Noah among the peoples! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
Then We did drown the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
And lo! of his persuasion verily was Abraham </P>
<P><A NAME="037_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
When he came unto his Lord with a whole heart; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
When he said unto his father and his folk: What is it that ye worship ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
Is it a falsehood - gods beside Allah - that ye desire ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_087"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT>
What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_088"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT>
And he glanced a glance at the stars </P>
<P><A NAME="037_089"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT>
Then said: Lo! I feel sick! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_090"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT>
And they turned their backs and went away from him. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_091"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">91</FONT>
Then turned he to their gods and said: Will ye not eat ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_092"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">92</FONT>
What aileth you that ye speak not ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_093"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">93</FONT>
Then he attacked them, striking with his right hand. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_094"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">94</FONT>
And (his people) came toward him, hastening. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_095"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">95</FONT>
He said: Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve </P>
<P><A NAME="037_096"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">96</FONT>
When Allah hath created you and what ye make ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_097"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">97</FONT>
They said: Build for him a building and fling him in the red-hotfire. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_098"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">98</FONT>
And they designed a snare for him, but We made them the undermost. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_099"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">99</FONT>
And he said: Lo! I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_100"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">100</FONT>
My Lord! Vouchsafe me of the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_101"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">101</FONT>
So We gave him tidings of a gentle son. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_102"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">102</FONT>
And when (his son) was old enough to walk with him, (Abraham) said: O my  dear son, I have seen in a dream that I must sacrifice thee. So look, what thinkest thou  ? He said: O my father! Do that which thou art commanded. Allah willing, thou shalt  find me of the steadfast. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_103"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">103</FONT>
Then, when they had both surrendered (to Allah), and he had flung him down  upon his face, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_104"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">104</FONT>
We called unto him: O Abraham! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_105"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">105</FONT>
Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_106"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">106</FONT>
Lo! that verily was a clear test. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_107"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">107</FONT>
Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_108"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">108</FONT>
And We left for him among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<P><A NAME="037_109"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">109</FONT>
Peace be unto Abraham! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_110"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">110</FONT>
Thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_111"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">111</FONT>
Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_112"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">112</FONT>
And we gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac, a prophet of the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_113"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">113</FONT>
And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are some who do good, and  some who plainly wrong themselves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_114"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">114</FONT>
And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_115"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">115</FONT>
And saved them and their people from the great distress, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_116"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">116</FONT>
And helped them so that they became the victors. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_117"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">117</FONT>
And We gave them the clear Scripture </P>
<P><A NAME="037_118"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">118</FONT>
And showed them the right path. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_119"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">119</FONT>
And We left for them among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<P><A NAME="037_120"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">120</FONT>
Peace be unto Moses and Aaron! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_121"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">121</FONT>
Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_122"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">122</FONT>
Lo! they are two of Our believing slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_123"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">123</FONT>
And lo! Elias was of those sent (to warn), </P>
<P><A NAME="037_124"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">124</FONT>
When he said unto his folk: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_125"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">125</FONT>
Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the Best of creators, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_126"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">126</FONT>
Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_127"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">127</FONT>
But they denied him, so they surely will be haled forth (to the doom) </P>
<P><A NAME="037_128"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">128</FONT>
Save single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_129"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">129</FONT>
And we left for him among the later folk (the salutation): </P>
<P><A NAME="037_130"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">130</FONT>
Peace be unto Elias! </P>
<P><A NAME="037_131"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">131</FONT>
Lo! thus do We reward the good. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_132"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">132</FONT>
Lo! he is one of our believing slaves. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_133"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">133</FONT>
And lo! Lot verily was of those sent (to warn). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_134"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">134</FONT>
When We saved him and his household, every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_135"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">135</FONT>
Save an old woman among those who stayed behind; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_136"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">136</FONT>
Then We destroyed the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_137"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">137</FONT>
And lo! ye verily pass by (the ruin of) them in the morning </P>
<P><A NAME="037_138"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">138</FONT>
And at night-time; have ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_139"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">139</FONT>
And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent (to warn) </P>
<P><A NAME="037_140"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">140</FONT>
When he fled unto the laden ship, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_141"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">141</FONT>
And then drew lots and was of those rejected; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_142"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">142</FONT>
And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_143"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">143</FONT>
And had he not been one of those who glorify (Allah) </P>
<P><A NAME="037_144"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">144</FONT>
He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_145"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">145</FONT>
Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_146"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">146</FONT>
And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him; </P>
<P><A NAME="037_147"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">147</FONT>
And We sent him to a hundred thousand (folk) or more </P>
<P><A NAME="037_148"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">148</FONT>
And they believed, therefor We gave them comfort for a while. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_149"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">149</FONT>
Now ask them (O Muhammad): Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have  sons ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_150"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">150</FONT>
Or created We the angels females while they were present ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_151"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">151</FONT>
Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say: </P>
<P><A NAME="037_152"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">152</FONT>
Allah hath begotten. Allah! verily they tell a lie. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_153"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">153</FONT>
(And again of their falsehood): He hath preferred daughters to sons. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_154"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">154</FONT>
What aileth you ? How judge ye ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_155"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">155</FONT>
Will ye not then reflect ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_156"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">156</FONT>
Or have ye a clear warrant ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_157"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">157</FONT>
Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_158"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">158</FONT>
And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know  well that they will be brought before (Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_159"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">159</FONT>
Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute (unto Him), </P>
<P><A NAME="037_160"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">160</FONT>
Save single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_161"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">161</FONT>
Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_162"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">162</FONT>
Ye cannot excite (anyone) against Him. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_163"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">163</FONT>
Save him who is to burn in hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_164"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">164</FONT>
There is not one of us but hath his known position. </P>

Lo! we, even we are they who set the ranks, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_166"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">166</FONT>
Lo! we, even we are they who hymn His praise </P>
<P><A NAME="037_167"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">167</FONT>
And indeed they used to say: </P>
<P><A NAME="037_168"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">168</FONT>
If we had but a reminder from the men of old </P>
<P><A NAME="037_169"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">169</FONT>
We would be single-minded slaves of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_170"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">170</FONT>
Yet (now that it is come) they disbelieve therein; but they will come to know. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_171"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">171</FONT>
And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent (to warn) </P>
<P><A NAME="037_172"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">172</FONT>
That they verily would be helped, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_173"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">173</FONT>
And that Our host, they verily would be the victors. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_174"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">174</FONT>
So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) awhile, </P>
<P><A NAME="037_175"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">175</FONT>
And watch, for they will (soon) see. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_176"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">176</FONT>
Would they hasten on Our doom ? </P>
<P><A NAME="037_177"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">177</FONT>
But when it cometh home to them, then it will be a hapless morn for those  who have been warned. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_178"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">178</FONT>
Withdraw from them awhile </P>
<P><A NAME="037_179"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">179</FONT>
And watch, for they will (soon) see. </P>
<P><A NAME="037_180"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">180</FONT>
Glorified be thy Lord, the Lord of Majesty, from that which they attribute  (unto Him) </P>
<P><A NAME="037_181"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">181</FONT>
And peace be unto those sent (to warn). </P>
<P><A NAME="037_182"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">182</FONT>
And praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds! <HR>
