Allah it is Who created the heavens and the earth, and that which is between  them, in six Days. Then He mounted the Throne. Ye have not, beside Him, a  protecting friend or mediator. Will ye not then remember ? </P>

Such is the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, the Mighty, the  Merciful, </P>
<P><A NAME="032_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>

Then He made his seed from a draught of despised fluid; </P>
<P><A NAME="032_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Then He fashioned him and breathed into him of His Spirit; and appointed  for you hearing and sight and hearts. Small thanks give ye! </P>
<P><A NAME="032_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
And they say: When we are lost in the earth, how can we then be re-created ?  Nay but they are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="032_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Say: The angel of death, who hath charge concerning you, will gather you,  and afterward unto your Lord ye will be returned. </P>

Only those believe in Our revelations who, when they are reminded of them,  fall down prostrate and hymn the praise of their Lord, and they are not scornful, </P>
<P><A NAME="032_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Who forsake their beds to cry unto their Lord in fear and hope, and spend of  that We have bestowed on them. </P>
<P><A NAME="032_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
No soul knoweth what is kept hid for them of joy, as a reward for what they  used to do. </P>

Is he who is a believer like unto him who is an evil-liver ? They are not alike. </P>
<P><A NAME="032_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>

<P><A NAME="032_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And who doth greater wrong than he who is reminded of the revelations of  his Lord, then turneth from them. Lo! We shall requite the guilty. </P>
<P><A NAME="032_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
We verily gave Moses the Scripture; so be not ye in doubt of his receiving it;  and We appointed it a guidance for the Children of Israel. </P>
