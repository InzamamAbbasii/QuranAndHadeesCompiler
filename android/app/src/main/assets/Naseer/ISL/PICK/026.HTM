Ta. Sin. Mim. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
It may be that thou tormentest thyself (O Muhammad) because they believe  not. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their  necks would remain bowed before it. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but  they turn away from it. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Now they have denied (the Truth); but there will come unto them tidings of  that whereat they used to scoff. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to  grow therein ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
And when thy Lord called Moses, saying: Go unto the wrongdoing folk, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor  send for Aaron (to help me). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
He said: Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with  you, Hearing. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
And come together unto Pharaoh and say: Lo! we bear a message of the Lord  of the Worlds, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
(Saying): Let the Children of Israel go with us. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
(Pharaoh) said (unto Moses): Did we not rear thee among us as a child ? And  thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the  ingrates. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
He said: I did it then, when I was of those who are astray. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a  command and appointed me (of the number) of those sent (by Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast  enslaved the Children of Israel. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
(Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them,  if ye had but sure belief. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
(Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
(Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a  madman! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did  but understand. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
(Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place  thee among the prisoners. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
He said: Even though I show thee something plain ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
(Pharaoh) said: Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
Then he flung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
(Pharaoh) said unto the chiefs about him: Lo! this is verily a knowing  wizard, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
They said: Put him off, (him) and his brother, and send into the cities  summoners </P>
<P><A NAME="026_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
(They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a  reward for us if we are the winners ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
Moses said unto them: Throw what ye are going to throw! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said: By Pharaoh's  might, lo! we verily are the winners. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely  show. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
And the wizards were flung prostrate, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
The Lord of Moses and Aaron. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
(Pharaoh) said: Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he  doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know.  Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you  every one. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
They said: It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are  the first of the believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
And We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night, for ye will  be pursued. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
(Who said): Lo! these indeed are but a little troop, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
And lo! they are offenders against us. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
And lo! we are a ready host. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
Thus did We take them away from gardens and watersprings, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
And treasures and a fair estate. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of  Israel to inherit them. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
And they overtook them at sunrise. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said: Lo! we are  indeed caught. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
He said: Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
Then We inspired Moses, saying: Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted,  and each part was as a mountain vast. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
Then brought We near the others to that place. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
And We saved Moses and those with him, every one; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
And We drowned the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
Recite unto them the story of Abraham: </P>
<P><A NAME="026_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
When he said unto his father and his folk: What worship ye ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
He said: Do they hear you when ye cry ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
Or do they benefit or harm you ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
He said: See now that which ye worship, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
Ye and your forefathers! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
Lo! they are (all) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
Who created me, and He doth guide me, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
And Who feedeth me and watereth me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
And when I sicken, then He healeth me, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
And Who causeth me to die, then giveth me life (again), </P>
<P><A NAME="026_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
And give unto me a good report in later generations. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_087"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT>
And abase me not on the day when they are raised, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_088"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT>
The day when wealth and sons avail not (any man) </P>
<P><A NAME="026_089"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT>
Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_090"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT>
And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off (evil). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_091"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">91</FONT>
And hell will appear plainly to the erring. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_092"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">92</FONT>
And it will be said unto them: Where is (all) that ye used to worship </P>
<P><A NAME="026_093"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">93</FONT>
Instead of Allah ? Can they help you or help themselves ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_094"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">94</FONT>
Then will they be hurled therein, they and the seducers </P>
<P><A NAME="026_095"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">95</FONT>
And the hosts of Iblis, together. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_096"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">96</FONT>
And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein: </P>
<P><A NAME="026_097"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">97</FONT>
By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest </P>
<P><A NAME="026_098"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">98</FONT>
When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_099"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">99</FONT>
It was but the guilty who misled us. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_100"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">100</FONT>
Now we have no intercessors </P>
<P><A NAME="026_101"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">101</FONT>
Nor any loving friend. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_102"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">102</FONT>
Oh, that we had another turn (on earth), that we might be of the believers! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_103"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">103</FONT>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers! </P>
<P><A NAME="026_104"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">104</FONT>
And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_105"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">105</FONT>
Noah's folk denied the messengers (of Allah), </P>
<P><A NAME="026_106"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">106</FONT>
When their brother Noah said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_107"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">107</FONT>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_108"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">108</FONT>
So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_109"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">109</FONT>
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_110"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">110</FONT>
So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_111"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">111</FONT>
They said: Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest (of the people) follow  thee ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_112"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">112</FONT>
He said: And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing (in  the past) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_113"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">113</FONT>
Lo! their reckoning is my Lord's concern, if ye but knew; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_114"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">114</FONT>
And I am not (here) to repulse believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_115"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">115</FONT>
I am only a plain warner. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_116"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">116</FONT>
They said: If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned  (to death). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_117"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">117</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_118"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">118</FONT>
Therefor judge Thou between us, a (conclusive) judgment, and save me and  those believers who are with me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_119"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">119</FONT>
And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_120"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">120</FONT>
Then afterward We drowned the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_121"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">121</FONT>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_122"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">122</FONT>
And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_123"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">123</FONT>
(The tribe of) A'ad denied the messengers (of Allah). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_124"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">124</FONT>
When their brother Hud said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_125"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">125</FONT>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_126"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">126</FONT>
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_127"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">127</FONT>
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_128"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">128</FONT>
Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_129"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">129</FONT>
And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_130"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">130</FONT>
And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_131"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">131</FONT>
Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_132"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">132</FONT>
Keep your duty toward Him Who hath aided you with (the good things) that  ye know, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_133"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">133</FONT>
Hath aided you with cattle and sons. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_134"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">134</FONT>
And gardens and watersprings. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_135"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">135</FONT>
Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_136"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">136</FONT>
They said: It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who  preach; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_137"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">137</FONT>
This is but a fable of the men of old, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_138"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">138</FONT>
And we shall not be doomed. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_139"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">139</FONT>
And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a  portent, yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_140"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">140</FONT>
And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_141"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">141</FONT>
(The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers (of Allah) </P>
<P><A NAME="026_142"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">142</FONT>
When their brother Salih said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_143"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">143</FONT>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_144"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">144</FONT>
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_145"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">145</FONT>
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_146"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">146</FONT>
Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_147"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">147</FONT>
In gardens and watersprings. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_148"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">148</FONT>
And tilled fields and heavy-sheathed palm-trees, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_149"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">149</FONT>
Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_150"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">150</FONT>
Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_151"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">151</FONT>
And obey not the command of the prodigal, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_152"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">152</FONT>
Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_153"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">153</FONT>
They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_154"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">154</FONT>
Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_155"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">155</FONT>
He said: (Behold) this she-camel. She hath the right to drink (at the well),  and ye have the right to drink, (each) on an appointed day. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_156"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">156</FONT>
And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful  day. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_157"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">157</FONT>
But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_158"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">158</FONT>
So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of  them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_159"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">159</FONT>
And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_160"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">160</FONT>
The folk of Lot denied the messengers (of Allah), </P>
<P><A NAME="026_161"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">161</FONT>
When their brother Lot said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_162"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">162</FONT>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_163"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">163</FONT>
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_164"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">164</FONT>
And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord  of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_165"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">165</FONT>
What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_166"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">166</FONT>
And leave the wives your Lord created for you ? Nay, but ye are froward  folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_167"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">167</FONT>
They said: If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_168"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">168</FONT>
He said: I am in truth of those who hate your conduct. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_169"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">169</FONT>
My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_170"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">170</FONT>
So We saved him and his household, every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_171"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">171</FONT>
Save an old woman among those who stayed behind. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_172"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">172</FONT>
Then afterward We destroyed the others. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_173"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">173</FONT>
And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have  been warned. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_174"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">174</FONT>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_175"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">175</FONT>
And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_176"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">176</FONT>
The dwellers in the wood (of Midian) denied the messengers (of Allah), </P>
<P><A NAME="026_177"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">177</FONT>
When Shu'eyb said unto them: Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_178"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">178</FONT>
Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_179"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">179</FONT>
So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_180"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">180</FONT>
And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of  the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_181"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">181</FONT>
Give full measure, and be not of those who give less (than the due). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_182"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">182</FONT>
And weigh with the true balance. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_183"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">183</FONT>
Wrong not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the  earth. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_184"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">184</FONT>
And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the  men of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_185"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">185</FONT>
They said: Thou art but one of the bewitched; </P>
<P><A NAME="026_186"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">186</FONT>
Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_187"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">187</FONT>
Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_188"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">188</FONT>
He said: My Lord is Best Aware of what ye do. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_189"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">189</FONT>
But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of  gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_190"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">190</FONT>
Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_191"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">191</FONT>
And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_192"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">192</FONT>
And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_193"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">193</FONT>
Which the True Spirit hath brought down </P>
<P><A NAME="026_194"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">194</FONT>
Upon thy heart, that thou mayst be (one) of the warners, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_195"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">195</FONT>
In plain Arabic speech. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_196"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">196</FONT>
And lo! it is in the Scriptures of the men of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_197"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">197</FONT>
Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_198"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">198</FONT>
And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_199"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">199</FONT>
And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_200"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">200</FONT>
Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_201"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">201</FONT>
They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_202"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">202</FONT>
So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_203"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">203</FONT>
Then they will say: Are we to be reprieved ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_204"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">204</FONT>
Would they (now) hasten on Our doom ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_205"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">205</FONT>
Hast thou then seen, if We content them for (long) years, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_206"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">206</FONT>
And then cometh that which they were promised, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_207"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">207</FONT>
(How) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_208"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">208</FONT>
And We destroyed no township but it had its warners </P>
<P><A NAME="026_209"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">209</FONT>
For reminder, for We never were oppressors. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_210"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">210</FONT>
The devils did not bring it down. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_211"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">211</FONT>
It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_212"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">212</FONT>
Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_213"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">213</FONT>
Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_214"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">214</FONT>
And warn thy tribe of near kindred, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_215"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">215</FONT>
And lower thy wing (in kindness) unto those believers who follow thee. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_216"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">216</FONT>
And if they (thy kinsfolk) disobey thee, say: Lo! I am innocent of what they  do. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_217"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">217</FONT>
And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_218"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">218</FONT>
Who seeth thee when thou standest up (to pray) </P>
<P><A NAME="026_219"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">219</FONT>
And (seeth) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate (in worship). </P>
<P><A NAME="026_220"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">220</FONT>
Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_221"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">221</FONT>
Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_222"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">222</FONT>
They descend on every sinful, false one. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_223"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">223</FONT>
They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_224"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">224</FONT>
As for poets, the erring follow them. </P>
<P><A NAME="026_225"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">225</FONT>
Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley, </P>
<P><A NAME="026_226"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">226</FONT>
And how they say that which they do not ? </P>
<P><A NAME="026_227"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">227</FONT>
Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and  vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come  to know by what a (great) reverse they will be overturned! <HR>
