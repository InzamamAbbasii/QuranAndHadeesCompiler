Ta. Ha. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
We have not revealed unto thee (Muhammad) this Qur'an that thou shouldst  be distressed, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
But as a reminder unto him who feareth, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
The Beneficent One, Who is established on the Throne. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the  earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever is beneath the sod. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
And if thou speakest aloud, then lo! He knoweth the secret (thought) and  (that which is yet) more hidden. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Allah! There is no God save Him. His are the most beautiful names. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Hath there come unto thee the story of Moses ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
When he saw a fire and said unto his folk: Lo! Wait! I see a fire afar off.  Peradventure I may bring you a brand therefrom or may find guidance at the fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
And when he reached it, he was called by name: O Moses! </P>
<P><A NAME="020_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
Lo! I, even I, am thy Lord, So take off thy shoes, for lo! thou art in the holy  valley of Tuwa. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And I have chosen thee, so hearken unto that which is inspired. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
Lo! I, even I, am Allah, There is no God save Me. So serve Me and establish  worship for My remembrance. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
Lo! the Hour is surely coming. But I will to keep it hidden, that every soul  may be rewarded for that which it striveth (to achieve). </P>
<P><A NAME="020_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Therefor, let not him turn thee aside from (the thought of) it who believeth  not therein but followeth his own desire, lest thou perish. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And what is that in thy right hand, O Moses ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
He said: This is my staff whereon I lean, and wherewith I bear down  branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
He said: Cast it down, O Moses! </P>
<P><A NAME="020_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
So he cast it down, and lo! it was a serpent, gliding. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
He said: Grasp it and fear not. We shall return it to its former state. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And thrust thy hand within thine armpit, it will come forth white without  hurt. (That will be) another token. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
That We may show thee (some) of Our greater portents, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
Go thou unto Pharaoh! Lo! he hath transgressed (the bounds). </P>
<P><A NAME="020_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
(Moses) said: My Lord! relieve my mind </P>
<P><A NAME="020_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And ease my task for me; </P>
<P><A NAME="020_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
And loose a knot from my tongue, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
That they may understand my saying. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
Appoint for me a henchman from my folk, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Aaron, my brother. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
Confirm my strength with him </P>
<P><A NAME="020_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And let him share my task, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
That we may glorify Thee much </P>
<P><A NAME="020_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
And much remember Thee. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Lo! Thou art ever Seeing us. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
He said: Thou art granted thy request, O Moses. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
And indeed, another time, already We have shown thee favour, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
When we inspired in thy mother that which is inspired, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
Saying: Throw him into the ark, and throw it into the river, then the river  shall throw it on to the bank, and there an enemy to Me and an enemy to him shall  take him. And I endued thee with love from Me that thou mightest be trained  according to My will, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
When thy sister went and said: Shall I show you one who will nurse him ?  and we restored thee to thy mother that her eyes might be refreshed and might not  sorrow. And thou didst kill a man and We delivered thee from great distress, and tried  thee with a heavy trial. And thou didst tarry years among the folk of Midian. Then  camest thou (hither) by (My) providence, O Moses, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
And I have attached thee to Myself. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Go, thou and thy brother, with My tokens, and be not faint in remembrance  of Me. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
Go, both of you, unto Pharaoh. Lo! he hath transgressed (the bounds). </P>
<P><A NAME="020_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
And speak unto him a gentle word, that peradventure he may heed or fear. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
They said: Our Lord! Lo! we fear that he may be beforehand with us or that  he may play the tyrant. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
He said: Fear not. Lo! I am with you twain, Hearing and Seeing. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
So go ye unto him and say: Lo! we are two messengers of thy Lord. So let  the children of Israel go with us, and torment them not. We bring thee a token from  thy Lord. And peace will be for him who followeth right guidance. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
Lo! it hath been revealed unto us that the doom will be for him who denieth  and turneth away. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
(Pharaoh) said: Who then is the Lord of you twain, O Moses ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
He said: Our Lord is He Who gave unto everything its nature, then guided it  aright. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
He said: What then is the state of the generations of old ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
He said: The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord  neither erreth nor forgetteth, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
Who hath appointed the earth as a bed and hath threaded roads for you  therein and hath sent down water from the sky and thereby We have brought forth  divers kinds of vegetation, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
(Saying): Eat ye and feed your cattle. Lo! herein verily are portents for men  of thought. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
Thereof We created you, and thereunto We return you, and thence We bring  you forth a second time. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
And We verily did show him all Our tokens, but he denied them and refused. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
He said: Hast come to drive us out from our land by thy magic, O Moses ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
But we surely can produce for thee magic the like thereof; so appoint a tryst  between us and you, which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep, at a place  convenient (to us both). </P>
<P><A NAME="020_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
(Moses) said: Your tryst shall be the day of the feast, and let the people  assemble when the sun hath risen high. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
Then Pharaoh went and gathered his strength, then came (to the appointed  tryst). </P>
<P><A NAME="020_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
Moses said unto them: Woe unto you! Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He  extirpate you by some punishment. He who lieth faileth miserably. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
Then they debated one with another what they must do, and they kept their  counsel secret. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
They said: Lo! these are two wizards who would drive you out from your  country by their magic, and destroy your best traditions; </P>
<P><A NAME="020_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
So arrange your plan, and come in battle line. Whoso is uppermost this day  will be indeed successful. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
They said: O Moses! Either throw first, or let us be the first to throw ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
He said: Nay, do ye throw! Then lo! their cords and their staves, by their  magic, appeared to him as though they ran. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
And Moses conceived a fear in his mind. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
We said: Fear not! Lo! thou art the higher. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
Throw that which is in thy right hand! It will eat up that which they have  made. Lo! that which they have made is but a wizard's artifice, and a wizard shall not  be successful to whatever point (of skill) he may attain. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
Then the wizards were (all) flung down prostrate, crying: We believe in the  Lord of Aaron and Moses. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
(Pharaoh) said: Ye put faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he is your  chief who taught you magic. Now surely I shall cut off your hands and your feet  alternately, and I shall crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and ye shall know for  certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
They said: We choose thee not above the clear proofs that have come unto  us, and above Him Who created us. So decree what thou wilt decree. Thou wilt end  for us only this life of the world. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
Lo! we believe in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins and the magic  unto which thou didst force us. Allah is better and more lasting. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
Lo! whoso cometh guilty unto his Lord, verily for him is hell. There he will  neither die nor live. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
But whoso cometh unto Him a believer, having done good works, for such  are the high stations; </P>
<P><A NAME="020_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
Gardens of Eden underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for  ever. That is the reward of him who groweth. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
And verily We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night and  strike for them a dry path in the sea, fearing not to be overtaken, neither being afraid  (of the sea). </P>
<P><A NAME="020_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
Then Pharaoh followed them with his hosts and there covered them that  which did cover them of the sea. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
And Pharaoh led his folk astray, he did not guide them. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and we made a  covenant with you on the holy mountain's side, and sent down on you the manna and  the quails, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
(Saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and  transgress not in respect thereof lest My wrath come upon you: and he on whom My  wrath cometh, he is lost indeed. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
And lo! verily I am Forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and  doeth good, and afterward walketh aright. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
And (it was said): What hath made thee hasten from thy folk, O Moses ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
He said: They are close upon my track. I hastened unto Thee, my Lord, that  Thou mightest be well pleased. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
He said: Lo! We have tried thy folk in thine absence, and As-Samiri hath  misled them. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
Then Moses went back unto his folk, angry and sad. He said: O my people!  Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise ? Did the time appointed then appear  too long for you, or did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you,  that ye broke tryst with me ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_087"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT>
They said: We broke not tryst with thee of our own will, but we were laden  with burdens of ornaments of the folk, then cast them (in the fire), for thus As-Samiri  proposed. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_088"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT>
Then he produced for them a calf, of saffron hue, which gave forth a lowing  sound. And they cried: This is your god and the god of Moses, but he hath forgotten. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_089"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT>
See they not, then, that it returneth no saying unto them and possesseth for  them neither hurt nor use ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_090"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT>
And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand: O my people! Ye are but being  seduced therewith, for lo! your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me and obey my  order. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_091"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">91</FONT>
They said: We shall by no means cease to be its votaries till Moses return  unto us. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_092"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">92</FONT>
He (Moses) said: O Aaron! What held thee back when thou didst see them  gone astray, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_093"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">93</FONT>
That thou followedst me not ? Hast thou then disobeyed my order ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_094"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">94</FONT>
He said: O son of my mother! Clutch not my beard nor my head! I feared lest  thou shouldst say: Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel, and hast  not waited for my word. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_095"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">95</FONT>
(Moses) said: And what hast thou to say, O Samiri ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_096"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">96</FONT>
He said: I perceived what they perceive not, so I seized a handful from the  footsteps of the messenger, and then threw it in. Thus my soul commended to me. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_097"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">97</FONT>
(Moses) said: Then go! and lo! in this life it is for thee to say: Touch me not!  and lo! there is for thee a tryst thou canst not break. Now look upon thy god of which  thou hast remained a votary. Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the  sea. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_098"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">98</FONT>
Your God is only Allah, than Whom there is no other God. He embraceth all  things in His knowledge. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_099"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">99</FONT>
Thus relate We unto thee (Muhammad) some tidings of that which happened  of old, and We have given thee from Our presence a reminder. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_100"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">100</FONT>
Whoso turneth away from it, he verily will bear a burden on the Day of  Resurrection, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_101"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">101</FONT>
Abiding under it - an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_102"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">102</FONT>
The day when the Trumpet is blown. On that day we assemble the guilty  white-eyed (with terror), </P>
<P><A NAME="020_103"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">103</FONT>
Murmuring among themselves: Ye have tarried but ten (days). </P>
<P><A NAME="020_104"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">104</FONT>
We are Best Aware of what they utter when their best in conduct say: Ye  have tarried but a day. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_105"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">105</FONT>
They will ask thee of the mountains (on that day). Say: My Lord will break  them into scattered dust. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_106"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">106</FONT>
And leave it as an empty plain, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_107"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">107</FONT>
Wherein thou seest neither curve nor ruggedness. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_108"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">108</FONT>
On that day they follow the summoner who deceiveth not, and voices are  hushed for the Beneficent, and thou hearest but a faint murmur. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_109"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">109</FONT>
On that day no intercession availeth save (that of) him unto whom the  Beneficent hath given leave and whose word He accepteth. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_110"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">110</FONT>
He knoweth (all) that is before them and (all) that is behind them, while they  cannot compass it in knowledge. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_111"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">111</FONT>
And faces humble themselves before the Living, the Eternal. And he who  beareth (a burden of) wrongdoing is indeed a failure (on that day). </P>
<P><A NAME="020_112"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">112</FONT>
And he who hath done some good works, being a believer, he feareth not  injustice nor begrudging (of his wage). </P>
<P><A NAME="020_113"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">113</FONT>
Thus we have revealed it as a Lecture in Arabic, and have displayed therein  certain threats, that peradventure they may keep from evil or that it may cause them to  take heed. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_114"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">114</FONT>
Then exalted be Allah, the True King! And hasten not (O Muhammad) with  the Qur'an ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee, and say: My Lord!  Increase me in knowledge. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_115"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">115</FONT>
And verily We made a covenant of old with Adam, but he forgot, and We  found no constancy in him. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_116"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">116</FONT>
And when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, they fell  prostrate (all) save Iblis; he refused. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_117"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">117</FONT>
Therefor we said: O Adam! This is an enemy unto thee and unto thy wife, so  let him not drive you both out of the Garden so that thou come to toil. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_118"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">118</FONT>
It is (vouchsafed) unto thee that thou hungerest not therein nor art naked, </P>
<P><A NAME="020_119"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">119</FONT>
And that thou thirstest not therein nor art exposed to the sun's heat. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_120"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">120</FONT>
But the devil whispered to him, saying: O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree  of immortality and power that wasteth not away ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_121"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">121</FONT>
Then they twain ate thereof, so that their shame became apparent unto them,  and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden.  And Adam disobeyed his Lord, so went astray. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_122"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">122</FONT>
Then his Lord chose him, and relented toward him, and guided him. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_123"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">123</FONT>
He said: Go down hence, both of you, one of you a foe unto the other. But  when there come unto you from Me a guidance, then whoso followeth My guidance,  he will not go astray nor come to grief. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_124"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">124</FONT>
But he who turneth away from remembrance of Me, his will be a narrow life,  and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_125"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">125</FONT>
He will say: My Lord! Wherefor hast Thou gathered me (hither) blind, when  I was wont to see ? </P>
<P><A NAME="020_126"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">126</FONT>
He will say: So (it must be). Our revelations came unto thee but thou didst  forget them. In like manner thou art forgotten this Day. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_127"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">127</FONT>
Thus do We reward him who is prodigal and believeth not the revelations of  his Lord; and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_128"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">128</FONT>
Is it not a guidance for them (to know) how many a generation We destroyed  before them, amid whose dwellings they walk ? Lo! therein verily are signs for men  of thought. </P>
<P><A NAME="020_129"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">129</FONT>
And but for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord, and a term  already fixed, the judgment would have been inevitable (in this world). </P>
