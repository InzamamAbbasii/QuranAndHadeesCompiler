<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">53. an-Najm: The Star</H1>
<P><A NAME="053_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
By the Star when it setteth, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
Your comrade erreth not, nor is deceived; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
Nor doth he speak of (his own) desire. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
It is naught save an inspiration that is inspired, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Which one of mighty powers hath taught him, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
One vigorous; and he grew clear to view </P>
<P><A NAME="053_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
When he was on the uppermost horizon. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Then he drew nigh and came down </P>
<P><A NAME="053_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
And He revealed unto His slave that which He revealed. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
The heart lied not (in seeing) what it saw. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
Will ye then dispute with him concerning what he seeth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And verily he saw him yet another time </P>
<P><A NAME="053_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
By the lote-tree of the utmost boundary, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
Nigh unto which is the Garden of Abode. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
When that which shroudeth did enshroud the lote-tree, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
The eye turned not aside nor yet was overbold. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
Verily he saw one of the greater revelations of his Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
Have ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza </P>
<P><A NAME="053_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And Manat, the third, the other ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
Are yours the males and His the females ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
That indeed were an unfair division! </P>
<P><A NAME="053_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which  Allah hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which (they)  themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
Or shall man have what he coveteth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
But unto Allah belongeth the after (life), and the former. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And how many angels are in the heavens whose intercession availeth naught  save after Allah giveth leave to whom He chooseth and accepteth. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
Lo! it is those who disbelieve in the Hereafter who name the angels with the  names of females. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
And they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but a guess, and lo! a  guess can never take the place of the truth. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
Then withdraw (O Muhammad) from him who fleeth from Our remembrance  and desireth but the life of the world. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Such is their sum of knowledge. Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who  strayeth, and He is Best Aware of him whom goeth right. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
And unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in  the earth, that He may reward those who do evil with that which they have done, and  reward those who do good with goodness. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
Those who avoid enormities of sin and abominations, save the unwilled  offences - (for them) lo! thy Lord is of vast mercy. He is Best Aware of you (from the  time) when He created you from the earth, and when ye were hidden in the bellies of  your mothers. Therefor ascribe not purity unto yourselves. He is Best Aware of him  who wardeth off (evil). </P>
<P><A NAME="053_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
Didst thou (O Muhammad) observe him who turned away, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
And gave a little, then was grudging ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Hath he knowledge of the Unseen so that he seeth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
Or hath he not had news of what is in the books of Moses </P>
<P><A NAME="053_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
And Abraham who paid his debt: </P>
<P><A NAME="053_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
That no laden one shall bear another's load, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
And that man hath only that for which he maketh effort, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
And that his effort will be seen. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
And afterward he will be repaid for it with fullest payment; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
And that thy Lord, He is the goal; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
And that He it is who maketh laugh, and maketh weep, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
And that He it is Who giveth death and giveth life; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
And that He createth the two spouses, the male and the female, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
From a drop (of seed) when it is poured forth; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
And that He hath ordained the second bringing forth; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
And that He it is Who enricheth and contenteth; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
And that He it is Who is the Lord of Sirius; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
And that He destroyed the former (tribe of) A'ad, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And (the tribe of) Thamud He spared not; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
And the folk of Noah aforetime, Lo! they were more unjust and more  rebellious; </P>
<P><A NAME="053_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
And Al-Mu'tafikah He destroyed </P>
<P><A NAME="053_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
So that there covered them that which did cover. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
Concerning which then, of the bounties of thy Lord, canst thou dispute ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
This is a warner of the warners of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
The threatened Hour is nigh. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
None beside Allah can disclose it. </P>
<P><A NAME="053_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
Marvel ye then at this statement, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
And laugh and not weep, </P>
<P><A NAME="053_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
While ye amuse yourselves ? </P>
<P><A NAME="053_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
Rather prostrate yourselves before Allah and serve Him. <HR>
