Sad. By the renowned Qur'an, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
Nay, but those who disbelieve are in false pride and schism. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
How many a generation We destroyed before them, and they cried out when  it was no longer the time for escape! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come unto them,  and the disbelievers say: This is a wizard, a charlatan. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Maketh he the gods One God ? Lo! that is an astounding thing. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
The chiefs among them go about, exhorting: Go and be staunch to your gods!  Lo! this is a thing designed. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
We have not heard of this in later religion. This is naught but an invention. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Hath the reminder been unto him (alone) among us ? Nay, but they are in  doubt concerning My reminder; nay but they have not yet tasted My doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Or are theirs the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the  Bestower ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Or is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them  theirs ? Then let them ascend by ropes! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
A defeated host are (all) the factions that are there. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
The folk of Noah before them denied (their messenger) and (so did the tribe  of) A'ad, and Pharaoh firmly planted, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And (the tribe of) Thamud, and the folk of Lot, and the dwellers in the wood:  these were the factions. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
Not one of them but did deny the messengers, therefor My doom was  justified, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
These wait for but one Shout, there will be no second thereto. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
They say: Our Lord! Hasten on for us our fate before the Day of Reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
Bear with what they say, and remember Our bondman David, lord of might,  Lo! he was ever turning in repentance (toward Allah). </P>
<P><A NAME="038_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
Lo! We subdued the hills to hymn the praises (of their Lord) with him at  nightfall and sunrise, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And the birds assembled; all were turning unto Him. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
We made his kingdom strong and gave him wisdom and decisive speech. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And hath the story of the litigants come unto thee ? How they climbed the  wall into the royal chamber; </P>
<P><A NAME="038_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
How they burst in upon David, and he was afraid of them. They said: Be not  afraid! (We are) two litigants, one of whom hath wronged the other, therefor judge  aright between us; be not unjust; and show us the fair way. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
Lo! this my brother hath ninety and nine ewes while I had one ewe; and he  said: Entrust it to me, and he conquered me in speech. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
(David) said: He hath wronged thee in demanding thine ewe in addition to  his ewes, and lo! many partners oppress one another, save such as believe and do  good works, and they are few. And David guessed that We had tried him, and he  sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and  repented. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
So We forgave him that; and lo! he had access to Our presence and a happy  journey's end. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
(And it was said unto him): O David! Lo! We have set thee as a viceroy in  the earth; therefor judge aright between mankind, and follow not desire that it beguile  thee from the way of Allah. Lo! those who wander from the way of Allah have an  awful doom, forasmuch as they forgot the Day of Reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in  vain. That is the opinion of those who disbelieve. And woe unto those who disbelieve,  from the Fire! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
Shall We treat those who believe and do good works as those who spread  corruption in the earth; or shall We treat the pious as the wicked ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
(This is) a Scripture that We have revealed unto thee, full of blessing, that  they may ponder its revelations, and that men of understanding may reflect. </P>

And We bestowed on David, Solomon. How excellent a slave! Lo! he was  ever turning in repentance (toward Allah). </P>
<P><A NAME="038_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
When there were shown to him at eventide lightfooted coursers </P>
<P><A NAME="038_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And he said: Lo! I have preferred the good things (of the world) to the  remembrance of my Lord; till they were taken out of sight behind the curtain. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
(Then he said): Bring them back to me, and fell to slashing (with his sword  their) legs and necks. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
And verily We tried Solomon, and set upon his throne a (mere) body. Then  did he repent. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me sovereignty such as shall  not belong to any after me. Lo! Thou art the Bestower. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
So We made the wind subservient unto him, setting fair by his command  whithersoever he intended. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
And the unruly, every builder and diver (made We subservient), </P>
<P><A NAME="038_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
And others linked together in chains, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
(Saying): This is Our gift, so bestow thou, or withhold, without reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>

And make mention (O Muhammad) of Our bondman Job, when he cried unto  his Lord (saying): Lo! the devil doth afflict me with distress and torment. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
(And it was said unto him): Strike the ground with thy foot. This (spring) is a  cool bath and a refreshing drink. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
And We bestowed on him (again) his household and therewith the like  thereof, a mercy from Us, and a memorial for men of understanding. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
And (it was said unto him): Take in thine hand a branch and smite therewith,  and break not thine oath. Lo! We found him steadfast, how excellent a slave! Lo! he  was ever turning in repentance (to his Lord). </P>
<P><A NAME="038_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
And make mention of Our bondmen, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, men of parts  and vision. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
Lo! We purified them with a pure thought, remembrance of the Home (of the  Hereafter). </P>
<P><A NAME="038_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
Lo! in Our sight they are verily of the elect, the excellent. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
And make mention of Ishmael and Elisha and Dhu'l-Kifl. All are of the  chosen. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
This is a reminder. And lo! for those who ward off (evil) is a happy journey's  end, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
Gardens of Eden, whereof the gates are opened for them, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
Wherein, reclining, they call for plenteous fruit and cool drink (that is)  therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
And with them are those of modest gaze, companions. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
This it is that ye are promised for the Day of Reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
Lo! this in truth is Our provision, which will never waste away. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
This (is for the righteous). And lo! for the transgressors there with be an evil  journey's end, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
Hell, where they will burn, an evil resting-place. </P>

Here is a boiling and an ice-cold draught, so let them taste it, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
And other (torment) of the kind in pairs (the two extremes)! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
Here is an army rushing blindly with you. (Those who are already in the Fire  say): No word of welcome for them. Lo! they will roast at the Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
They say: Nay, but you (misleaders), for you there is no word of welcome.  Ye prepared this for us (by your misleading). Now hapless is the plight. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
They say: Our Lord! Whoever did prepare this for us, oh, give him double  portion of the Fire! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
And they say: What aileth us that we behold not men whom we were wont to  count among the wicked ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
Did we take them (wrongly) for a laughing-stock, or have our eyes missed  them ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
Lo! that is very truth: the wrangling of the dwellers in the Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I am only a warner, and there is no God  save Allah, the One, the Absolute, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the Mighty,  the Pardoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
Say: It is tremendous tidings </P>

Whence ye turn away! </P>
<P><A NAME="038_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
I had no knowledge of the Highest Chiefs when they disputed; </P>
<P><A NAME="038_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
It is revealed unto me only that I may be a plain warner. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
When thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to create a mortal out of  mire, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
And when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My Spirit, then fall  down before him prostrate, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
The angels fell down prostrate, every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
Saving Iblis; he was scornful and became one of the disbelievers. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
He said: O Iblis! What hindereth thee from falling prostrate before that which  I have created with both My hands ? Art thou too proud or art thou of the high exalted  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="038_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
He said: I am better than him. Thou createdst me of fire, whilst him Thou  didst create of clay. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
He said: Go forth from hence, for lo! thou art outcast, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
And lo! My curse is on thee till the Day of Judgment. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Reprieve me till the day when they are raised. </P>

He said: Lo! thou art of those reprieved </P>
<P><A NAME="038_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
Until the day of the time appointed. </P>

He said: Then, by Thy might, I surely will beguile them every one, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
Save Thy single-minded slaves among them. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
He said: The Truth is, and the Truth I speak, </P>
<P><A NAME="038_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
That I shall fill hell with thee and with such of them as follow thee, together. </P>
<P><A NAME="038_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee for this, and I am no  simulating. </P>

Lo! it is naught else than a reminder for all peoples </P>
