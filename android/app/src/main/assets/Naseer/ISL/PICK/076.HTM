<P><A NAME="076_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Hath there come upon man (ever) any period of time in which he was a thing  unremembered ? </P>
<P><A NAME="076_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
Lo! We create man from a drop of thickened fluid to test him; so We make  him hearing, knowing. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
Lo! We have shown him the way, whether he be grateful or disbelieving. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers manacles and carcans and a raging  fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Lo! the righteous shall drink of a cup whereof the mixture is of Kafur, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
A spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah drink, making it gush forth  abundantly, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
(Because) they perform the vow and fear a day whereof the evil is wide- spreading, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
And feed with food the needy wretch, the orphan and the prisoner, for love  of Him, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
(Saying): We feed you, for the sake of Allah only. We wish for no reward  nor thanks from you; </P>
<P><A NAME="076_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Lo! we fear from our Lord a day of frowning and of fate. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Therefor Allah hath warded off from them the evil of that day, and hath  made them find brightness and joy; </P>
<P><A NAME="076_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
And hath awarded them for all that they endured, a Garden and silk attire; </P>
<P><A NAME="076_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
Reclining therein upon couches, they will find there neither (heat of) a sun  nor bitter cold. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
The shade thereof is close upon them and the clustered fruits thereof bow  down. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
Goblets of silver are brought round for them, and beakers (as) of glass </P>
<P><A NAME="076_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
(Bright as) glass but (made) of silver, which they (themselves) have  measured to the measure (of their deeds). </P>
<P><A NAME="076_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
There are they watered with a cup whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil, </P>
<P><A NAME="076_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
(The water of) a spring therein, named Salsabil. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
There wait on them immortal youths, whom, when thou seest, thou wouldst  take for scattered pearls. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
When thou seest, thou wilt see there bliss and high estate. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
Their raiment will be fine green silk and gold embroidery. Bracelets of silver  will they wear. Their Lord will slake their thirst with a pure drink. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
(And it will be said unto them): Lo! this is a reward for you. Your endeavour  (upon earth) hath found acceptance. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
Lo! We, even We, have revealed unto thee the Qur'an, a revelation; </P>
<P><A NAME="076_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
So submit patiently to thy Lord's command, and obey not of them any guilty  one or disbeliever. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
Remember the name of thy Lord at morn and evening. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And worship Him (a portion) of the night. And glorify Him through the  livelong night. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
Lo! these love fleeting life, and put behind them (the remembrance of) a  grievous day. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
We, even We, created them, and strengthened their frame. And when We  will, We can replace them, bringing others like them in their stead. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
Lo! this is an Admonishment, that whosoever will may choose a way unto  his Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Yet ye will not, unless Allah willeth. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="076_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
He maketh whom He will to enter His mercy, and for evil-doers hath  prepared a painful doom. <HR>
