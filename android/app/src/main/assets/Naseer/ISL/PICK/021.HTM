<P><A NAME="021_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Their reckoning draweth nigh for mankind, while they turn away in  heedlessness. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
Never cometh there unto them a new reminder from their Lord but they listen  to it while they play, </P>
<P><A NAME="021_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
With hearts preoccupied. And they confer in secret. The wrong-doers say: Is  this other than a mortal like you ? Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see (it) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
He saith: My Lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and the earth. He is  the Hearer, the Knower. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Nay, say they, (these are but) muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it;  nay, he is but a poet. Let him bring us a portent even as those of old (who were God's  messengers) were sent (with portents). </P>
<P><A NAME="021_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them (though  We sent them portents): would they then believe ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men, whom We  inspired. Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Then we fulfilled the promise unto them. So we delivered them and whom  We would, and We destroyed the prodigals. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Now We have revealed unto you a Scripture wherein is your Reminder. Have  ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered, and raised up  after them another folk! </P>
<P><A NAME="021_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
And, when they felt Our might, behold them fleeing from it! </P>
<P><A NAME="021_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
(But it was said unto them): Flee not, but return to that (existence) which  emasculated you and to your dwellings, that ye may be questioned. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
They cried: Alas for us! we were wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
And this their crying ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in play. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
If We had wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in Our presence  - if We ever did. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
Nay, but We hurl the true against the false, and it doth break its head and lo!  it vanisheth. And yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe (unto Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="021_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those  who dwell in His presence are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they weary; </P>
<P><A NAME="021_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
They glorify (Him) night and day; they flag not. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
Or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
If there were therein gods beside Allah, then verily both (the heavens and the  earth) had been disordered. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from all that  they ascribe (unto Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="021_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth, but they will be  questioned. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
Or have they chosen other gods beside Him ? say: Bring your proof (of their  godhead). This is the Reminder of those with me and those before me, but most of  them know not the Truth and so they are averse. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him, (saying): There  is no God save Me (Allah), so worship Me. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He  Glorified! Nay, but (those whom they call sons) are honoured slaves; </P>
<P><A NAME="021_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
They speak not until He hath spoken, and they act by His command. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
He knoweth what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot  intercede except for him whom He accepteth, and they quake for awe of Him. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
And one of them who should say: Lo! I am a god beside Him, that one We  should repay with hell. Thus We Repay wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of  one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water ? Will they  not then believe ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and We  have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And we have made the sky a roof withheld (from them). Yet they turn away  from its portents. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon.  They float, each in an orbit. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
We appointed immortality for no mortal before thee. What! if thou diest, can  they be immortal! </P>
<P><A NAME="021_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Every soul must taste of death, and We try you with evil and with good, for  ordeal. And unto Us ye will be returned. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
And when those who disbelieve behold thee, they but choose thee out for  mockery, (saying): Is this he who maketh mention of your gods ? And they would  deny all mention of the Beneficent. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
Man is made of haste. I shall show you My portents, but ask Me not to  hasten. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
And they say: When will this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not be able to  drive off the fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be helped! </P>
<P><A NAME="021_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
Nay, but it will come upon them unawares so that it will stupefy them, and  they will be unable to repel it, neither will they be reprieved. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
Messengers before thee, indeed, were mocked, but that whereat they mocked  surrounded those who scoffed at them. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Say: Who guardeth you in the night or in the day from the Beneficent ? Nay,  but they turn away from mention of their Lord! </P>
<P><A NAME="021_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
Or have they gods who can shield them from Us ? They cannot help  themselves nor can they be defended from Us. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
Nay, but We gave these and their fathers ease until life grew long for them.  See they not how we aim to the land, reducing it of its outlying parts ? Can they then  be the victors ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I warn you only by the Inspiration. But  the deaf hear not the call when they are warned. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
And if a breath of thy Lord's punishment were to touch them, they assuredly  would say: Alas for us! Lo! we were wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
And We set a just balance for the Day of Resurrection so that no soul is  wronged in aught. Though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard seed, We bring it.  And We suffice for reckoners. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
And We verily gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion (of right and wrong) and  a light and a Reminder for those who keep from evil, </P>
<P><A NAME="021_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
Those who fear their Lord in secret and who dread the Hour (of doom). </P>
<P><A NAME="021_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
This is a blessed Reminder that we have revealed: Will ye then reject it ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And We verily gave Abraham of old his proper course, and We were Aware  of him, </P>
<P><A NAME="021_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
When he said unto his father and his folk: What are these images unto which  ye pay devotion ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
They said: We found our fathers worshippers of them. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
He said: Verily ye and your fathers were in plain error. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
They said: Bringest thou unto us the truth, or art thou some jester ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
He said: Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who  created them; and I am of those who testify unto that. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
And, by Allah, I shall circumvent your idols after ye have gone away and  turned your backs. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
Then he reduced them to fragments, all save the chief of them, that haply  they might have recourse to it. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
They said: Who hath done this to our gods ? Surely it must be some evil- doer. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
They said: We heard a youth make mention of them, who is called Abraham. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
They said: Then bring him (hither) before the people's eyes that they may  testify. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
They said: Is it thou who hast done this to our gods, O Abraham ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
He said: But this, their chief hath done it. So question them, if they can  speak. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
Then gathered they apart and said: Lo! ye yourselves are the wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
And they were utterly confounded, and they said: Well thou knowest that  these speak not. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
He said: Worship ye then instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all,  nor harm you ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
Fie on you and all that ye worship instead of Allah! Have ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
They cried: Burn him and stand by your gods, if ye will be doing. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
We said: O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham, </P>
<P><A NAME="021_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
And they wished to set a snare for him, but We made them the greater losers. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
And We rescued him and Lot (and brought them) to the land which We have  blessed for (all) peoples. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and Jacob as a grandson. Each of them  We made righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
And We made them chiefs who guide by Our command, and We inspired in  them the doing of good deeds and the right establishment of worship and the giving of  alms, and they were worshippers of Us (alone). </P>
<P><A NAME="021_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
And unto Lot we gave judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him from  the community that did abominations. Lo! they were folk of evil, lewd. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
And We brought him in unto Our mercy. Lo! he was of the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
And Noah, when he cried of old, We heard his prayer and saved him and his  household from the great affliction. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
And delivered him from the people who denied Our revelations. Lo! they  were folk of evil, therefor did We drown them all. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field,  when people's sheep had strayed and browsed therein by night; and We were  witnesses to their judgment. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
And We made Solomon to understand (the case); and unto each of them We  gave judgment and knowledge. And we subdued the hills and the birds to hymn (His)  praise along with David. We were the doers (thereof). </P>
<P><A NAME="021_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
And We taught him the art of making garments (of mail) to protect you in  your daring. Are ye then thankful ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
And unto Solomon (We subdued) the wind in its raging. It set by his  command toward the land which We had blessed. And of everything We are Aware. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
And of the evil ones (subdued We unto him) some who dived (for pearls) for  him and did other work, and We were warders unto them. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
And Job, when he cried unto his Lord, (saying): Lo! adversity afflicteth me,  and Thou art Most Merciful of all who show mercy. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
Then We heard his prayer and removed that adversity from which he  suffered, and We gave him his household (that he had lost) and the like thereof along  with them, a mercy from Our store, and a remembrance for the worshippers; </P>
<P><A NAME="021_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
And (mention) Ishmael, and Idris, and Dhu'l-Kifl. All were of the steadfast. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
And We brought them in unto Our mercy. Lo! they are among the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_087"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT>
And (mention) Dhu'n-Nun, when he went off in anger and deemed that We  had no power over him, but he cried out in the darkness, saying: There is no God save  Thee. Be Thou Glorified! Lo! I have been a wrong-doer. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_088"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT>
Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish. Thus we save  believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_089"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT>
And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord: My Lord! Leave me not  childless, though Thou art the Best of inheritors. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_090"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT>
Then We heard his prayer, and bestowed upon him John, and adjusted his  wife (to bear a child) for him. Lo! they used to vie one with the other in good deeds,  and they cried unto Us in longing and in fear, and were submissive unto Us. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_091"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">91</FONT>
And she who was chaste, therefor We breathed into her (something) of Our  Spirit and made her and her son a token for (all) peoples. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_092"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">92</FONT>
Lo! this, your religion, is one religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_093"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">93</FONT>
And they have broken their religion (into fragments) among them, (yet) all  are returning unto Us. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_094"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">94</FONT>
Then whoso doeth some good works and is a believer, there will be no  rejection of his effort. Lo! We record (it) for him. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_095"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">95</FONT>
And there is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed: that they  shall not return. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_096"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">96</FONT>
Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they hasten out of every  mound, </P>
<P><A NAME="021_097"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">97</FONT>
And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide (in  terror), the eyes of those who disbelieve! (They say): Alas for us! We (lived) in  forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers! </P>
<P><A NAME="021_098"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">98</FONT>
Lo! ye (idolaters) and that which ye worship beside Allah are fuel of hell.  Thereunto ye will come. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_099"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">99</FONT>
If these had been gods they would not have come thither, but all will abide  therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_100"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">100</FONT>
Therein wailing is their portion, and therein they hear not. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_101"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">101</FONT>
Lo! those unto whom kindness hath gone forth before from Us, they will be  far removed from thence. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_102"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">102</FONT>
They will not hear the slightest sound thereof, while they abide in that which  their souls desire. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_103"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">103</FONT>
The Supreme Horror will not grieve them, and the angels will welcome  them, (saying): This is your Day which ye were promised; </P>
<P><A NAME="021_104"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">104</FONT>
The Day when We shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a written  scroll. As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise (binding)  upon Us. Lo! We are to perform it. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_105"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">105</FONT>
And verily we have written in the Scripture, after the Reminder: My  righteous slaves will inherit the earth: </P>
<P><A NAME="021_106"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">106</FONT>
Lo! there is a plain statement for folk who are devout. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_107"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">107</FONT>
We sent thee not save as a mercy for the peoples. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_108"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">108</FONT>
Say: It is only inspired in me that your God is One God. Will ye then  surrender (unto Him) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="021_109"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">109</FONT>
But if they are averse, then say: I have warned you all alike, although I know  not whether nigh or far is that which ye are promised. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_110"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">110</FONT>
Lo! He knoweth that which is said openly, and that which ye conceal. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_111"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">111</FONT>
And I know not but that this may be a trial for you, and enjoyment for a  while. </P>
<P><A NAME="021_112"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">112</FONT>
He saith: My Lord! Judge Thou with truth. Our Lord is the Beneficent,  Whose help is to be implored against that which ye ascribe (unto Him). <HR>
