<P><A NAME="061_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>

And (remember) when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Why  persecute ye me, when ye well know that I am Allah's messenger unto you ? So when  they went astray Allah sent their hearts astray. And Allah guideth not the evil-living  folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="061_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
And when Jesus son of Mary said: O Children of Israel! Lo! I am the  messenger of Allah unto you, confirming that which was (revealed) before me in the  Torah, and bringing good tidings of a messenger who cometh after me, whose name  is the Praised One. Yet when he hath come unto them with clear proofs, they say:  This is mere magic. </P>
<P><A NAME="061_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
And who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie against Allah when  he is summoned unto Al-Islam ? And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="061_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Fain would they put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will  perfect His light however much the disbelievers are averse. </P>
<P><A NAME="061_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
He it is Who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the religion of  truth, that He may make it conqueror of all religion however much idolaters may be  averse. </P>
<P><A NAME="061_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
O ye who believe! Shall I show you a commerce that will save you from a  painful doom ? </P>
<P><A NAME="061_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Ye should believe in Allah and His messenger, and should strive for the  cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is better for you, if ye did but  know. </P>
<P><A NAME="061_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
He will forgive you your sins and bring you into Gardens underneath which  rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in Gardens of Eden. That is the supreme triumph. </P>
<P><A NAME="061_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And (He will give you) another (blessing) which ye love: help from Allah  and present victory. Give good tidings (O Muhammad) to believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="061_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
O ye who believe! Be Allah's helpers, even as Jesus son of Mary said unto  the disciples: Who are my helpers for Allah ? They said: We are Allah's helpers. And  a party of the Children of Israel believed, while a party disbelieved. Then We  strengthened those who believed against their foe, and they became the uppermost. <HR>
