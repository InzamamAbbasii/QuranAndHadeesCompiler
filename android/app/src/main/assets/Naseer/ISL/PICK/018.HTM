<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">18. al-Kahf: The Cave</H1>
<P><A NAME="018_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Praise be to Allah Who hath revealed the Scripture unto His slave, and hath  not placed therein any crookedness, </P>
<P><A NAME="018_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
(But hath made it) straight, to give warning of stern punishment from Him,  and to bring unto the believers who do good works the news that theirs will be a fair  reward, </P>
<P><A NAME="018_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
Wherein they will abide for ever; </P>
<P><A NAME="018_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And to warn those who say: Allah hath chosen a son, </P>
<P><A NAME="018_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
(A thing) whereof they have no knowledge, nor (had) their fathers, Dreadful  is the word that cometh out of their mouths. They speak naught but a lie. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Yet it may be, if they believe not in this statement, that thou (Muhammad)  wilt torment thy soul with grief over their footsteps. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
Lo! We have placed all that is on the earth as an ornament thereof that We  may try them: which of them is best in conduct. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
And lo! We shall make all that is thereon a barren mound. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Or deemest thou that the People of the Cave and the Inscription are a wonder  among Our portents ? </P>
<P><A NAME="018_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
When the young men fled for refuge to the Cave and said: Our Lord! Give us  mercy from Thy presence, and shape for us right conduct in our plight. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Then We sealed up their hearing in the Cave for a number of years. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
And afterward We raised them up that We might know which of the two  parties would best calculate the time that they had tarried. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
We narrate unto thee their story with truth. Lo! they were young men who  believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
And We made firm their hearts when they stood forth and said: Our Lord is  the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We cry unto no God beside Him, for then  should we utter an enormity. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
These, our people, have chosen (other) gods beside Him though they bring  no clear warrant (vouchsafed) to them. And who doth greater wrong than he who  inventeth a lie concerning Allah ? </P>
<P><A NAME="018_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah,  then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and will  prepare for you a pillow in your plight. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their  cave to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the cleft  thereof. That was (one) of the portents of Allah. He whom Allah guideth, he indeed is  led aright, and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding  friend. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
And thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep, and  We caused them to turn over to the right and the left, and their dog stretching out his  paws on the threshold. If thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly  turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of them. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another.  A speaker from among them said: How long have ye tarried ? They said: We have   tarried a day or some part of a day, (Others) said: Your Lord best knoweth what ye  have tarried. Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city, and let him  see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous  and let no man know of you. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
For they, if they should come to know of you, will stone you or turn you  back to their religion; then ye will never prosper. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they  might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no  doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among  themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best  concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of  worship over them. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
(Some) will say: They were three, their dog the fourth, and (some) say: Five,  their dog the sixth, guessing at random; and (some) say: Seven, and their dog the  eighth. Say (O Muhammad): My Lord is Best Aware of their number. None knoweth  them save a few. So contend not concerning them except with an outward contending,  and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
And say not of anything: Lo! I shall do that tomorrow, </P>
<P><A NAME="018_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
Except if Allah will. And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say:  It may be that my Lord guideth me unto a nearer way of truth than this. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
And (it is said) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
Say: Allah is Best Aware how long they tarried. His is the Invisible of the  heavens and the earth. How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing! They have no  protecting friend beside Him, and He maketh none to share in His government. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy  Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside  Him. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and  evening, seeking His Countenance; and let not thine eyes overlook them, desiring the  pomp of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless  of Our remembrance, who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been  abandoned. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
Say: (It is) the truth from the Lord of you (all). Then whosoever will, let him  believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve. Lo! We have prepared for  disbelievers Fire. Its tent encloseth them. If they ask for showers, they will be  showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the faces. Calamitous the  drink and ill the resting-place! </P>
<P><A NAME="018_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Lo! as for those who believe and do good works - Lo! We suffer not the  reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden, wherein rivers flow beneath  them; therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest  silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon throne therein. Blest the reward, and fair the  resting-place! </P>
<P><A NAME="018_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
Coin for them a similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We had assigned  two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put  between them tillage. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We  caused a river to gush forth therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
And he had fruit. And he said unto his comrade, when he spake with him: I  am more than thee in wealth, and stronger in respect of men. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
And he went into his garden, while he (thus) wronged himself. He said: I  think not that all this will ever perish. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
I think not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back  unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
His comrade, when he (thus) spake with him, exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in  Him Who created thee of dust, then of a drop (of seed), and then fashioned thee a man  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="018_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
But He is Allah, my Lord, and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which Allah  willeth (will come to pass)! There is no strength save in Allah! Though thou seest me  as less than thee in wealth and children, </P>
<P><A NAME="018_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and will send  on it a bolt from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside, </P>
<P><A NAME="018_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
Or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst  not make search for it. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
And his fruit was beset (with destruction). Then began he to wring his hands  for all that he had spent upon it, when (now) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to  say: Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord! </P>
<P><A NAME="018_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah, nor could he save  himself. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
In this case is protection only from Allah, the True, He is Best for reward,  and best for consequence. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We  send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then  becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter. Allah is able to do all things. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of the world. But the good  deeds which endure are better in thy Lord's sight for reward, and better in respect of  hope. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
And (bethink you of) the Day when we remove the hills and ye see the earth  emerging, and We gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
And they are set before thy Lord in ranks (and it is said unto them): Now  verily have ye come unto Us as We created you at the first. But ye thought that We  had set no tryst for you. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
And the Book is placed, and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is  therein, and they say: What kind of a Book is this that leaveth not a small thing nor a  great thing but hath counted it! And they find all that they did confronting them, and  thy Lord wrongeth no-one. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
And (remember) when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam,  and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against his  Lord's command. Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead  of Me, when they are an enemy unto you ? Calamitous is the exchange for evil-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
I made them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor  their own creation; nor choose I misleaders for (My) helpers. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
And (be mindful of) the Day when He will say: Call those partners of Mine  whom ye pretended. Then they will cry unto them, but they will not hear their prayer,  and We shall set a gulf of doom between them. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
And the guilty behold the Fire and know that they are about to fall therein,  and they find no way of escape thence. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Qur'an all manner of  similitudes, but man is more than anything contentious. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
And naught hindereth mankind from believing when the guidance cometh  unto them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord unless (it be that they wish) that  the judgment of the men of old should come upon them or (that) they should be  confronted with the Doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners.  Those who disbelieve contend with falsehood in order to refute the Truth thereby.  And they take Our revelations and that wherewith they are threatened as a jest. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
And who doth greater wrong than he who hath been reminded of the  revelations of his Lord, yet turneth away from them and forgetteth what his hands  send forward (to the Judgment) ? Lo! on their hearts We have placed coverings so  that they understand not, and in their ears a deafness. And though thou call them to  the guidance, in that case they can never be led aright. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
Thy Lord is the Forgiver, Full of Mercy. If He took them to task (now) for  what they earn, He would hasten on the doom for them; but theirs is an appointed  term from which they will find no escape. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
And (all) those townships! We destroyed them when they did wrong, and We  appointed a fixed time for their destruction. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
And when Moses said unto his servant: I will not give up until I reach the  point where the two rivers meet, though I march on for ages. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
And when they reached the point where the two met, they forgot their fish,  and it took its way into the waters, being free. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
And when they had gone further, he said unto his servant: Bring us our  breakfast. Verily we have found fatigue in this our journey. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
He said: Didst thou see, when we took refuge on the rock, and I forgot the  fish - and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it - it took its way into the  waters by a marvel. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
He said: This is that which we have been seeking. So they retraced their steps  again. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
Then found they one of Our slaves, unto whom We had given mercy from  Us, and had taught him knowledge from Our presence. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
Moses said unto him: May I follow thee, to the end that thou mayst teach me  right conduct of that which thou hast been taught ? </P>
<P><A NAME="018_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
He said: Lo! thou canst not bear with me. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
How canst thou bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any  knowledge ? </P>
<P><A NAME="018_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
He said: Allah willing, thou shalt find me patient and I shall not in aught  gainsay thee. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
He said: Well, if thou go with me, ask me not concerning aught till I myself  make mention of it unto thee. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
So they twain set out till, when they were in the ship, he made a hole therein.  (Moses) said: Hast thou made a hole therein to drown the folk thereof ? Thou verily  hast done a dreadful thing. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
He said: Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me ? </P>
<P><A NAME="018_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
(Moses) said: Be not wroth with me that I forgot, and be not hard upon me  for my fault. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
So they twain journeyed on till, when they met a lad, he slew him. (Moses)  said: What! Hast thou slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man ? Verily thou hast  done a horrid thing. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
He said: Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me ? </P>
<P><A NAME="018_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
(Moses) said: If I ask thee after this concerning aught, keep not company  with me. Thou hast received an excuse from me. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
So they twain journeyed on till, when they came unto the folk of a certain  township, they asked its folk for food, but they refused to make them guests. And  they found therein a wall upon the point of falling into ruin, and he repaired it.  (Moses) said: If thou hadst wished, thou couldst have taken payment for it. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
He said: This is the parting between thee and me! I will announce unto thee  the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working on the river, and I wished  to mar it, for there was a king behind them who is taking every ship by force. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
And as for the lad, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should  oppress them by rebellion and disbelief. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
And we intended that their Lord should change him for them for one better in  purity and nearer to mercy. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was  beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and their father had been righteous, and thy  Lord intended that they should come to their full strength and should bring forth their  treasure as a mercy from their Lord; and I did it not upon my own command. Such is  the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
They will ask thee of Dhu'l-Qarneyn. Say: I shall recite unto you a  remembrance of him. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
Lo! We made him strong in the land and gave him unto every thing a road. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
And he followed a road </P>
<P><A NAME="018_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
Till, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, he found it setting in a  muddy spring, and found a people thereabout. We said: O Dhu'l-Qarneyn! Either  punish or show them kindness. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_087"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT>
He said: As for him who doeth wrong, we shall punish him, and then he will  be brought back unto his Lord, Who will punish him with awful punishment! </P>
<P><A NAME="018_088"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT>
But as for him who believeth and doeth right, good will be his reward, and  We shall speak unto him a mild command. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_089"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT>
Then he followed a road </P>
<P><A NAME="018_090"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT>
Till, when he reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising on a  people for whom We had appointed no shelter therefrom. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_091"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">91</FONT>
So (it was). And We knew all concerning him. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_092"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">92</FONT>
Then he followed a road </P>
<P><A NAME="018_093"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">93</FONT>
Till, when he came between the two mountains, he found upon their hither  side a folk that scarce could understand a saying. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_094"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">94</FONT>
They said: O Dhu'l-Qarneyn! Lo! Gog and Magog are spoiling the land. So  may we pay thee tribute on condition that thou set a barrier between us and them ? </P>
<P><A NAME="018_095"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">95</FONT>
He said: That wherein my Lord hath established me is better (than your  tribute). Do but help me with strength (of men), I will set between you and them a  bank. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_096"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">96</FONT>
Give me pieces of iron - till, when he had levelled up (the gap) between the  cliffs, he said: Blow! - till, when he had made it a fire, he said: Bring me molten  copper to pour thereon. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_097"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">97</FONT>
And (Gog and Magog) were not able to surmount, nor could they pierce (it). </P>
<P><A NAME="018_098"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">98</FONT>
He said: This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord  cometh to pass, He will lay it low, for the promise of my Lord is true. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_099"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">99</FONT>
And on that day we shall let some of them surge against others, and the  Trumpet will be blown. Then We shall gather them together in one gathering. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_100"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">100</FONT>
On that day we shall present hell to the disbelievers, plain to view, </P>
<P><A NAME="018_101"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">101</FONT>
Those whose eyes were hoodwinked from My reminder, and who could not  bear to hear. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_102"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">102</FONT>
Do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose My bondmen as protecting  friends beside Me ? Lo! We have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_103"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">103</FONT>
Say: Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works ? </P>
<P><A NAME="018_104"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">104</FONT>
Those whose effort goeth astray in the life of the world, and yet they reckon  that they do good work. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_105"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">105</FONT>
Those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord and in the  meeting with Him. Therefor their works are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection We  assign no weight to them. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_106"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">106</FONT>
That is their reward: hell, because they disbelieved, and made a jest of Our  revelations and Our messengers. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_107"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">107</FONT>
Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs are the Gardens of Paradise  for welcome, </P>
<P><A NAME="018_108"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">108</FONT>
Wherein they will abide, with no desire to be removed from thence. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_109"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">109</FONT>
Say: Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord, verily the sea  would be used up before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even though We  brought the like thereof to help. </P>
<P><A NAME="018_110"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">110</FONT>
Say: I am only a mortal like you. My Lord inspireth in me that your God is  only One God. And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord, let him do  righteous work, and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord. <HR>
