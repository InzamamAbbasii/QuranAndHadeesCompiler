<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">71. Nuh: Noah</H1>
<P><A NAME="071_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Lo! We sent Noah unto his people (saying): Warn thy people ere the painful  doom come unto them. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
He said: O my people! Lo! I am a plain warner unto you </P>
<P><A NAME="071_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
(Bidding you): Serve Allah and keep your duty unto Him and obey me, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
That He may forgive you somewhat of your sins and respite you to an  appointed term. Lo! the term of Allah, when it cometh, cannot be delayed, if ye but  knew. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Lo! I have called unto my people night and day </P>
<P><A NAME="071_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
But all my calling doth but add to their repugnance; </P>
<P><A NAME="071_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
And lo! whenever I call unto them that Thou mayst pardon them they thrust  their fingers in their ears and cover themselves with their garments and persist (in  their refusal) and magnify themselves in pride. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
And lo! I have called unto them aloud, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
And lo! I have made public proclamation unto them, and I have appealed to  them in private. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
And I have said: Seek pardon of your Lord. Lo! He was ever Forgiving. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
He will let loose the sky for you in plenteous rain, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
And will help you with wealth and sons, and will assign unto you Gardens  and will assign unto you rivers. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
What aileth you that ye hope not toward Allah for dignity </P>
<P><A NAME="071_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
When He created you by (divers) stages ? </P>
<P><A NAME="071_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
See ye not how Allah hath created seven heavens in harmony, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
And hath made the moon a light therein, and made the sun a lamp ? </P>
<P><A NAME="071_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And Allah hath caused you to grow as a growth from the earth, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
And afterward He maketh you return thereto, and He will bring you forth  again, a (new) forthbringing. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And Allah hath made the earth a wide expanse for you </P>
<P><A NAME="071_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
That ye may thread the valley-ways thereof. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
Noah said: My Lord! Lo! they have disobeyed me and followed one whose  wealth and children increase him in naught save ruin; </P>
<P><A NAME="071_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And they have plotted a mighty plot, </P>
<P><A NAME="071_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
And they have said: Forsake not your gods. Forsake not Wadd, nor Suwa',  nor Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
And they have led many astray, and Thou increasest the wrong-doers in  naught save error. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
Because of their sins they were drowned, then made to enter a Fire. And they  found they had no helpers in place of Allah. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And Noah said: My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers in the land. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
If Thou shouldst leave them, they will mislead Thy slaves and will beget  none save lewd ingrates. </P>
<P><A NAME="071_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
My Lord! Forgive me and my parents and him who entereth my house  believing, and believing men and believing women, and increase not the wrong-doers  in aught save ruin. <HR>
