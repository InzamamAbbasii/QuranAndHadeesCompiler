<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">70. al-Ma`arij: The Ladders</H1>
<P><A NAME="070_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
A questioner questioned concerning the doom about to fall </P>
<P><A NAME="070_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
Upon the disbelievers, which none can repel, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
From Allah, Lord of the Ascending Stairways </P>
<P><A NAME="070_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
(Whereby) the angels and the Spirit ascend unto Him in a Day whereof the  span is fifty thousand years. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
But be patient (O Muhammad) with a patience fair to see. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Lo! they behold it afar off </P>
<P><A NAME="070_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
While we behold it nigh: </P>
<P><A NAME="070_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
The day when the sky will become as molten copper, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
And the hills become as flakes of wool, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
And no familiar friend will ask a question of his friend </P>
<P><A NAME="070_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Though they will be given sight of them. The guilty man will long to be able  to ransom himself from the punishment of that day at the price of his children </P>
<P><A NAME="070_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
And his spouse and his brother </P>
<P><A NAME="070_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And his kin that harboured him </P>
<P><A NAME="070_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
And all that are in the earth, if then it might deliver him. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
But nay! for lo! it is the fire of hell </P>
<P><A NAME="070_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Eager to roast; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
It calleth him who turned and fled (from truth), </P>
<P><A NAME="070_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
And hoarded (wealth) and withheld it. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
Lo! man was created anxious, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
Fretful when evil befalleth him </P>
<P><A NAME="070_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And, when good befalleth him, grudging; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
Save worshippers. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
Who are constant at their worship </P>
<P><A NAME="070_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
And in whose wealth there is a right acknowledged </P>
<P><A NAME="070_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
For the beggar and the destitute; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And those who believe in the Day of Judgment, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
And those who are fearful of their Lord's doom - </P>
<P><A NAME="070_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
Lo! the doom of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure - </P>
<P><A NAME="070_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
And those who preserve their chastity </P>
<P><A NAME="070_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Save with their wives and those whom their right hands possess, for thus  they are not blameworthy; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
But whoso seeketh more than that, those are they who are transgressors; </P>
<P><A NAME="070_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And those who keep their pledges and their covenant, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
And those who stand by their testimony </P>
<P><A NAME="070_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
And those who are attentive at their worship. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
These will dwell in Gardens, honoured. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
What aileth those who disbelieve, that they keep staring toward thee (O  Muhammad), open-eyed, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
On the right and on the left, in groups ? </P>
<P><A NAME="070_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
Doth every man among them hope to enter the Garden of Delight ? </P>
<P><A NAME="070_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
Nay, verily. Lo! We created them from what they know. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
But nay! I swear by the Lord of the rising-places and the setting-places of the  planets that We verily are Able </P>
<P><A NAME="070_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
To replace them by (others) better than them. And we are not to be outrun. </P>
<P><A NAME="070_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
So let them chat and play until they meet their Day which they are promised, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
The day when they come forth from the graves in haste, as racing to a goal, </P>
<P><A NAME="070_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
With eyes aghast, abasement stupefying them: Such is the Day which they  are promised. <HR>
