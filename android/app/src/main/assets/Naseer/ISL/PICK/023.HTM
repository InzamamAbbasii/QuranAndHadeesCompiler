<P><A NAME="023_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Successful indeed are the believers </P>
<P><A NAME="023_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
Who are humble in their prayers, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
And who shun vain conversation, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And who are payers of the poor-due; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
And who guard their modesty - </P>
<P><A NAME="023_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Save from their wives or the (slaves) that their right hands possess, for then  they are not blameworthy, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
But whoso craveth beyond that, such are transgressors - </P>
<P><A NAME="023_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
And who are shepherds of their pledge and their covenant, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
And who pay heed to their prayers. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
These are the heirs </P>
<P><A NAME="023_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Who will inherit paradise. There they will abide. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
Verily We created man from a product of wet earth; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
Then placed him as a drop (of seed) in a safe lodging; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
Then fashioned We the drop a clot, then fashioned We the clot a little lump,  then fashioned We the little lump bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and then  produced it as another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
Then lo! after that ye surely die. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection ye are raised (again). </P>
<P><A NAME="023_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And We have created above you seven paths, and We are never unmindful of  creation. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
And we send down from the sky water in measure, and We give it lodging in  the earth, and lo! We are Able to withdraw it. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
Then We produce for you therewith gardens of date-palms and grapes,  wherein is much fruit for you and whereof ye eat; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And a tree that springeth forth from Mount Sinai that groweth oil and relish  for the eaters. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And lo! in the cattle there is verily a lesson for you. We give you to drink of  that which is in their bellies, and many uses have ye in them, and of them do ye eat; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And on them and on the ship ye are carried. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
And We verily sent Noah unto his folk, and he said: O my people! Serve  Allah. Ye have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
But the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said: This is only a mortal  like you who would make himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He surely could  have sent down angels. We heard not of this in the case of our fathers of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
He is only a man in whom is a madness, so watch him for a while. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
Then We inspired in him, saying: Make the ship under Our eyes and Our  inspiration. Then, when Our command cometh and the oven gusheth water, introduce  therein of every (kind) two spouses, and thy household save him thereof against  whom the Word hath already gone forth. And plead not with Me on behalf of those  who have done wrong. Lo! they will be drowned. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
And when thou art on board the ship, thou and whoso is with thee, then say:  Praise be to Allah Who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
And say: My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing-place, for Thou art  Best of all who bring to land. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Lo! herein verily are portents, for lo! We are ever putting (mankind) to the  test. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
Then, after them, We brought forth another generation; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And we sent among them a messenger of their own, saying: Serve Allah, Ye  have no other God save Him. Will ye not ward off (evil) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
And the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the  Hereafter, and whom We had made soft in the life of the world, said: This is only a  mortal like you, who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that ye drink. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
If ye were to obey a mortal like yourselves, then, lo! ye surely would be  losers. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Doth he promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust and  bones, will (again) be brought forth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
Begone, begone, with that which ye are promised! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and we shall  not be raised (again). </P>
<P><A NAME="023_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
He is only a man who hath invented a lie about Allah. We are not going to  put faith in him. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
He said: My Lord! Help me because they deny me. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
He said: In a little while they surely will become repentant. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
So the (Awful) Cry overtook them rightfully, and We made them like as  wreckage (that a torrent hurleth). A far removal for wrongdoing folk! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Then after them We brought forth other generations. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
No nation can outstrip its term, nor yet postpone it. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger  came unto a nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another (to  disaster) and We made them bywords. A far removal for folk who believe not! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our tokens and a clear  warrant </P>
<P><A NAME="023_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned (them) and they were despotic  folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
And they said: Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves, and whose  folk are servile unto us ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
So they denied them, and became of those who were destroyed. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
And We verily gave Moses the Scripture, that haply they might go aright. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a portent, and We gave them  refuge on a height, a place of flocks and watersprings. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
O ye messengers! Eat of the good things, and do right. Lo! I am Aware of  what ye do. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
And lo! this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your  duty unto Me. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
But they (mankind) have broken their religion among them into sects, each  group rejoicing in its tenets. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
So leave them in their error till a time. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
Think they that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them </P>
<P><A NAME="023_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
We hasten unto them with good things ? Nay, but they perceive not. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
Lo! those who go in awe for fear of their Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
And those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are  about to return unto their Lord, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
These race for the good things, and they shall win them in the race. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
And we task not any soul beyond its scope, and with Us is a Record which  speaketh the truth, and they will not be wronged. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
Nay, but their hearts are in ignorance of this (Qur'an), and they have other  works, besides, which they are doing; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
Till when We grasp their luxurious ones with the punishment, behold! they  supplicate. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
Supplicate not this day! Assuredly ye will not be helped by Us. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
My revelations were recited unto you, but ye used to turn back on your heels, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
In scorn thereof. Nightly did ye rave together. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
Have they not pondered the Word, or hath that come unto them which came  not unto their fathers of old ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
Or know they not their messenger, and so reject him ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
Or say they: There is a madness in him ? Nay, but he bringeth them the  Truth; and most of them are haters of the Truth. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
And if the Truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth  and whosoever is therein had been corrupted. Nay, We have brought them their  Reminder, but from their Reminder they now turn away. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
Or dost thou ask of them (O Muhammad) any tribute ? But the bounty of thy  Lord is better, for He is Best of all who make provision. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
And lo! thou summonest them indeed unto a straight path. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
And lo! those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed astray from the  path. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
Though We had mercy on them and relieved them of the harm afflicting  them, they still would wander blindly on in their contumacy. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
Already have We grasped them with punishment, but they humble not  themselves unto their Lord, nor do they pray, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
Until, when We open for them the gate of extreme punishment, behold! they  are aghast thereat. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
He it is Who hath created for you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give  ye! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
And He it is Who hath sown you broadcast in the earth, and unto Him ye will  be gathered. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
And He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and His is the difference of  night and day. Have ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
Nay, but they say the like of that which said the men of old; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
They say: When we are dead and have become (mere) dust and bones, shall  we then, forsooth, be raised again ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
We were already promised this, we and our forefathers. Lo! this is naught but  fables of the men of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
Say: Unto Whom (belongeth) the earth and whosoever is therein, if ye have  knowledge ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
They will say: Unto Allah. Say: Will ye not then remember ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
Say: Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Tremendous Throne  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_087"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT>
They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: Will ye not then keep  duty (unto Him) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_088"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT>
Say: In Whose hand is the dominion over all things and He protecteth, while  against Him there is no protection, if ye have knowledge ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_089"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT>
They will say: Unto Allah (all that belongeth). Say: How then are ye  bewitched ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_090"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT>
Nay, but We have brought them the Truth, and lo! they are liars. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_091"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">91</FONT>
Allah hath not chosen any son, nor is there any god along with Him; else  would each god have assuredly championed that which he created, and some of them  would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be Allah above all that they allege. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_092"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">92</FONT>
Knower of the Invisible and the Visible! and Exalted be He over all that they  ascribe as partners (unto Him)! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_093"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">93</FONT>
Say: My Lord! If Thou shouldst show me that which they are promised. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_094"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">94</FONT>
My Lord! then set me not among the wrongdoing folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_095"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">95</FONT>
And verily We are Able to show thee that which We have promised them. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_096"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">96</FONT>
Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best Aware of that which they  allege. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_097"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">97</FONT>
And say: My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions of the evil ones, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_098"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">98</FONT>
And I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they be present with me, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_099"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">99</FONT>
Until, when death cometh unto one of them, he saith: My Lord! Send me  back, </P>
<P><A NAME="023_100"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">100</FONT>
That I may do right in that which I have left behind! But nay! It is but a word  that he speaketh; and behind them is a barrier until the day when they are raised. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_101"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">101</FONT>
And when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that  day, nor will they ask of one another. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_102"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">102</FONT>
Then those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_103"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">103</FONT>
And those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls, in hell  abiding. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_104"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">104</FONT>
The fire burneth their faces, and they are glum therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_105"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">105</FONT>
(It will be said): Were not My revelations recited unto you, and then ye used  to deny them ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_106"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">106</FONT>
They will say: Our Lord! Our evil fortune conquered us, and we were erring  folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_107"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">107</FONT>
Our Lord! Oh, bring us forth from hence! If we return (to evil) then indeed  we shall be wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_108"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">108</FONT>
He saith: Begone therein, and speak not unto Me. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_109"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">109</FONT>
Lo! there was a party of My slaves who said: Our Lord! We believe, therefor  forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of all who show mercy; </P>
<P><A NAME="023_110"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">110</FONT>
But ye chose them for a laughing-stock until they caused you to forget  remembrance of Me, while ye laughed at them. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_111"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">111</FONT>
Lo! I have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast in that  they, even they, are the triumphant. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_112"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">112</FONT>
He will say: How long tarried ye in the earth, counting by years ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_113"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">113</FONT>
They will say: We tarried by a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep  count! </P>
<P><A NAME="023_114"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">114</FONT>
He will say: Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_115"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">115</FONT>
Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught, and that ye would not  be returned unto Us ? </P>
<P><A NAME="023_116"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">116</FONT>
Now Allah be Exalted, the True King! There is no God save Him, the Lord  of the Throne of Grace. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_117"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">117</FONT>
He who crieth unto any other god along with Allah hath no proof thereof. His  reckoning is only with his Lord. Lo! disbelievers will not be successful. </P>
<P><A NAME="023_118"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">118</FONT>
And (O Muhammad) say: My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for Thou art  Best of all who show mercy. <HR>
