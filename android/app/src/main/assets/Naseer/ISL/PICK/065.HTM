O Prophet! When ye (men) put away women, put them away for their (legal)  period and reckon the period, and keep your duty to Allah, your Lord. Expel them not  from their houses nor let them go forth unless they commit open immorality. Such are  the limits (imposed by) Allah; and whoso transgresseth Allah's limits, he verily  wrongeth his soul. Thou knowest not: it may be that Allah will afterward bring some  new thing to pass. </P>

Then, when they have reached their term, take them back in kindness or part  from them in kindness, and call to witness two just men among you, and keep your  testimony upright for Allah. Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last Day is exhorted to  act thus. And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, Allah will appoint a way out for  him, </P>
<P><A NAME="065_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation.  And whosoever putteth his trust in Allah, He will suffice him. Lo! Allah bringeth His  command to pass. Allah hath set a measure for all things. </P>
<P><A NAME="065_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And for such of your women as despair of menstruation, if ye doubt, their  period (of waiting) shall be three months, along with those who have it not. And for  those with child, their period shall be till they bring forth their burden. And  whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, He maketh his course easy for him. </P>
<P><A NAME="065_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
That is the commandment of Allah which He revealeth unto you. And whoso  keepeth his duty to Allah, He will remit from him his evil deeds and magnify reward  for him. </P>
<P><A NAME="065_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Lodge them where ye dwell, according to your wealth, and harass them not  so as to straiten life for them. And if they are with child, then spend for them till they  bring forth their burden. Then, if they give suck for you, give them their due payment  and consult together in kindness; but if ye make difficulties for one another, then let  some other woman give suck for him (the father of the child). </P>
<P><A NAME="065_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
Let him who hath abundance spend of his abundance, and he whose  provision is measured, let him spend of that which Allah hath given him. Allah asketh  naught of any soul save that which He hath given it. Allah will vouchsafe, after  hardship, ease. </P>
<P><A NAME="065_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
And how many a community revolted against the ordinance of its Lord and  His messengers, and We called it to a stern account and punished it with dire  punishment, </P>
<P><A NAME="065_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
So that it tasted the ill-effects of its conduct, and the consequence of its  conduct was loss. </P>
<P><A NAME="065_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Allah hath prepared for them stern punishment; so keep your duty to Allah,  O men of understanding! O ye who believe! Now Allah hath sent down unto you a  reminder, </P>
<P><A NAME="065_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
A messenger reciting unto you the revelations of Allah made plain, that He  may bring forth those who believe and do good works from darkness unto light. And  whosoever believeth in Allah and doeth right, He will bring him into Gardens  underneath which rivers flow, therein to abide for ever. Allah hath made good  provision for him. </P>
<P><A NAME="065_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
Allah it is who hath created seven heavens, and of the earth the like thereof.  The commandment cometh down among them slowly, that ye may know that Allah is  Able to do all things, and that Allah surroundeth all things in knowledge. <HR>
