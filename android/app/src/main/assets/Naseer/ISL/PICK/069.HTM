<P><A NAME="069_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
The Reality! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
What is the Reality ? </P>
<P><A NAME="069_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
Ah, what will convey unto thee what the reality is! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
(The tribes of) Thamud and A'ad disbelieved in the judgment to come. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the lightning. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
And as for A'ad, they were destroyed by a fierce roaring wind, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
Which He imposed on them for seven long nights and eight long days so that  thou mightest have seen men lying overthrown, as they were hollow trunks of palm- trees. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Canst thou (O Muhammad) see any remnant of them ? </P>
<P><A NAME="069_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
And Pharaoh and those before him, and the communities that were  destroyed, brought error, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, therefor did He grip them  with a tightening grip. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Lo! when the waters rose, We carried you upon the ship </P>
<P><A NAME="069_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
That We might make it a memorial for you, and that remembering ears (that  heard the story) might remember. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And when the trumpet shall sound one blast </P>
<P><A NAME="069_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
And the earth with the mountains shall be lifted up and crushed with one  crash, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
Then, on that day will the Event befall. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
And the heaven will split asunder, for that day it will be frail. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And the angels will be on the sides thereof, and eight will uphold the Throne  of thy Lord that day, above them. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
On that day ye will be exposed; not a secret of you will be hidden. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
Then, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say: Take,  read my book! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
Surely I knew that I should have to meet my reckoning. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
Then he will be in blissful state </P>
<P><A NAME="069_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
In a high garden </P>
<P><A NAME="069_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
Whereof the clusters are in easy reach. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
(And it will be said unto those therein): Eat and drink at ease for that which  ye sent on before you in past days. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
But as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say: Oh,  would that I had not been given my book </P>
<P><A NAME="069_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And knew not what my reckoning! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
Oh, would that it had been death! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
My wealth hath not availed me, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
My power hath gone from me. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
(It will be said): Take him and fetter him </P>
<P><A NAME="069_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
And then expose him to hell-fire </P>
<P><A NAME="069_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And then insert him in a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
Lo! He used not to believe in Allah the Tremendous, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
And urged not on the feeding of the wretched. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Therefor hath he no lover here this day, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
Nor any food save filth </P>
<P><A NAME="069_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
Which none but sinners eat. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
But nay! I swear by all that ye see </P>
<P><A NAME="069_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
And all that ye see not </P>
<P><A NAME="069_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
That it is indeed the speech of an illustrious messenger. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
It is not poet's speech - little is it that ye believe! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Nor diviner's speech - little is it that ye remember! </P>
<P><A NAME="069_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
And if he had invented false sayings concerning Us, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
We assuredly had taken him by the right hand </P>
<P><A NAME="069_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
And then severed his life-artery, </P>
<P><A NAME="069_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
And not one of you could have held Us off from him. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
And lo! it is a warrant unto those who ward off (evil). </P>
<P><A NAME="069_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
And lo! We know that some among you will deny (it). </P>
<P><A NAME="069_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
And lo! it is indeed an anguish for the disbelievers. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And lo! it is absolute truth. </P>
<P><A NAME="069_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
So glorify the name of thy Tremendous Lord. <HR>
