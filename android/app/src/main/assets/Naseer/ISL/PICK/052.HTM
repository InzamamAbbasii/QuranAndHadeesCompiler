<P><A NAME="052_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
By the Mount, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
And a Scripture inscribed </P>
<P><A NAME="052_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
On fine parchment unrolled, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And the House frequented, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
And the roof exalted, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
And the sea kept filled, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
Lo! the doom of thy Lord will surely come to pass; </P>
<P><A NAME="052_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
There is none that can ward it off. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
On the day when the heaven will heave with (awful) heaving, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
And the mountains move away with (awful) movement, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Then woe that day unto the deniers </P>
<P><A NAME="052_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
Who play in talk of grave matters; </P>
<P><A NAME="052_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
The day when they are thrust with a (disdainful) thrust, into the fire of hell </P>
<P><A NAME="052_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
(And it is said unto them): This is the Fire which ye were wont to deny. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
Is this magic, or do ye not see ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Endure the heat thereof, and whether ye are patient of it or impatient of it is  all one for you. Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
Lo! those who kept their duty dwell in gardens and delight, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
Happy because of what their Lord hath given them, and (because) their Lord  hath warded off from them the torment of hell-fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
(And it is said unto them): Eat and drink in health (as a reward) for what ye  used to do, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
Reclining on ranged couches. And we wed them unto fair ones with wide,  lovely eyes. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And they who believe and whose seed follow them in faith, We cause their  seed to join them (there), and We deprive them of nought of their (life's) work. Every  man is a pledge for that which he hath earned. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And We provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
There they pass from hand to hand a cup wherein is neither vanity nor cause  of sin. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
And there go round, waiting on them menservants of their own, as they were  hidden pearls. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
And some of them draw near unto others, questioning, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
Saying: Lo! of old, when we were with our families, we were ever anxious; </P>
<P><A NAME="052_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
But Allah hath been gracious unto us and hath preserved us from the torment  of the breath of Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
Lo! we used to pray unto Him of old. Lo! He is the Benign, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
Therefor warn (men, O Muhammad). By the grace of Allah thou art neither  soothsayer nor madman. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Or say they: (he is) a poet, (one) for whom we may expect the accident of  time ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
Say (unto them): Except (your fill)! Lo! I am with you among the expectant. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
Do their minds command them to do this, or are they an outrageous folk ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
Or say they: He hath invented it ? Nay, but they will not believe! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
Then let them produce speech the like thereof, if they are truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Or were they created out of naught ? Or are they the creators ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
Or did they create the heavens and the earth ? Nay, but they are sure of  nothing! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
Or do they own the treasures of thy Lord ? Or have they been given charge  (thereof) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
Or have they any stairway (unto heaven) by means of which they overhear  (decrees). Then let their listener produce some warrant manifest! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
Or hath He daughters whereas ye have sons ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
Or askest thou (Muhammad) a fee from them so that they are plunged in debt  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
Or possess they the Unseen so that they can write (it) down ? </P>
<P><A NAME="052_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Or seek they to ensnare (the messenger) ? But those who disbelieve, they are  the ensnared! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
Or have they any god beside Allah ? Glorified be Allah from all that they  ascribe as partner (unto Him)! </P>
<P><A NAME="052_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
And if they were to see a fragment of the heaven falling, they would say: A  heap of clouds. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
Then let them be (O Muhammad), till they meet their day, in which they will  be thunder-stricken, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
A day in which their guile will naught avail them, nor will they be helped. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a punishment beyond that. But  most of them know not. </P>
<P><A NAME="052_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
So wait patiently (O Muhammad) for thy Lord's decree, for surely thou art in  Our sight; and hymn the praise of thy Lord when thou uprisest, </P>
<P><A NAME="052_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
And in the night-time also hymn His praise, and at the setting of the stars. <HR>
