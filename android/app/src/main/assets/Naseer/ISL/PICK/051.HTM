<P><A NAME="051_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
By those that winnow with a winnowing </P>
<P><A NAME="051_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
And those that bear the burden (of the rain) </P>
<P><A NAME="051_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
And those that glide with ease (upon the sea) </P>
<P><A NAME="051_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And those who distribute (blessings) by command, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Lo! that wherewith ye are threatened is indeed true, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
And lo! the judgment will indeed befall. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
By the heaven full of paths, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Lo! ye, forsooth, are of various opinion (concerning the truth). </P>
<P><A NAME="051_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
He is made to turn away from it who is (himself) averse. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Accursed be the conjecturers </P>
<P><A NAME="051_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Who are careless in an abyss! </P>
<P><A NAME="051_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
They ask: When is the Day of Judgment ? </P>
<P><A NAME="051_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
(It is) the day when they will be tormented at the Fire, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
(And it will be said unto them): Taste your torment (which ye inflicted). This  is what ye sought to hasten. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
Lo! those who keep from evil will dwell amid gardens and watersprings, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Taking that which their Lord giveth them; for lo! aforetime they were doers  of good; </P>
<P><A NAME="051_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
They used to sleep but little of the night, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
And ere the dawning of each day would seek forgiveness, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And in their wealth the beggar and the outcast had due share. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And in the earth are portents for those whose faith is sure. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And (also) in yourselves. Can ye then not see ? </P>
<P><A NAME="051_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And in the heaven is your providence and that which ye are promised; </P>
<P><A NAME="051_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth, it is the truth, even as (it is  true) that ye speak. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
Hath the story of Abraham's honoured guests reached thee (O Muhammad) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="051_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
When they came in unto him and said: Peace! he answered, Peace! (and  thought): Folk unknown (to me). </P>
<P><A NAME="051_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
Then he went apart unto his housefolk so that they brought a fatted calf; </P>
<P><A NAME="051_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
And he set it before them, saying: Will ye not eat ? </P>
<P><A NAME="051_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
Then he conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not! and gave him tidings  of (the birth of) a wise son. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
Then his wife came forward, making moan, and smote her face, and cried: A  barren old woman! </P>
<P><A NAME="051_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
They said: Even so saith thy Lord. Lo! He is the Wise, the Knower. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
(Abraham) said: And (afterward) what is your errand, O ye sent (from Allah)  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="051_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
They said: Lo! we are sent unto a guilty folk, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
That we may send upon them stones of clay, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
Marked by thy Lord for (the destruction of) the wanton. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Then we brought forth such believers as were there. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
But We found there but one house of those surrendered (to Allah). </P>
<P><A NAME="051_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
And We left behind therein a portent for those who fear a painful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
And in Moses (too, there is a portent) when We sent him unto Pharaoh with  clear warrant, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
But he withdrew (confiding) in his might, and said: A wizard or a madman. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
So We seized him and his hosts and flung them in the sea, for he was  reprobate. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
And in (the tribe of) A'ad (there is a portent) when we sent the fatal wind  against them. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
It spared naught that it reached, but made it (all) as dust. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
And in (the tribe of) Thamud (there is a portent) when it was told them: Take  your ease awhile. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
But they rebelled against their Lord's decree, and so the thunderbolt overtook  them even while they gazed; </P>
<P><A NAME="051_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
And they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
And the folk of Noah aforetime. Lo! they were licentious folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent  (thereof). </P>
<P><A NAME="051_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
And the earth have We laid out, how gracious is the Spreader (thereof)! </P>
<P><A NAME="051_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
And all things We have created by pairs, that haply ye may reflect. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
Therefor flee unto Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you from him. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And set not any other god along with Allah; lo! I am a plain warner unto you  from Him. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
Even so there came no messenger unto those before them but they said: A  wizard or a madman! </P>
<P><A NAME="051_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
Have they handed down (the saying) as an heirloom one unto another ? Nay,  but they are froward folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
So withdraw from them (O Muhammad), for thou art in no wise  blameworthy, </P>
<P><A NAME="051_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
And warn, for warning profiteth believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
I created the jinn and humankind only that they might worship Me. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
I seek no livelihood from them, nor do I ask that they should feed Me. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
Lo! Allah! He it is that giveth livelihood, the Lord of unbreakable might. </P>
<P><A NAME="051_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
And lo! for those who (now) do wrong there is an evil day like unto the evil  day (which came for) their likes (of old); so let them not ask Me to hasten on (that  day). </P>
<P><A NAME="051_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
And woe unto those who disbelieve, from (that) their day which they are  promised. <HR>
