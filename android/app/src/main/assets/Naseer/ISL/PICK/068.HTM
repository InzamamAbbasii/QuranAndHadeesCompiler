<P><A NAME="068_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Nun. By the pen and that which they write (therewith), </P>
<P><A NAME="068_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
Thou art not, for thy Lord's favour unto thee, a madman. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
And lo! thine verily will be a reward unfailing. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And lo! thou art of a tremendous nature. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
And thou wilt see and they will see </P>
<P><A NAME="068_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
Which of you is the demented. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
Lo! thy Lord is Best Aware of him who strayeth from His way, and He is  Best Aware of those who walk aright. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Therefor obey not thou the rejecters </P>
<P><A NAME="068_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Who would have had thee compromise, that they may compromise. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Neither obey thou each feeble oath-monger, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Detracter, spreader abroad of slanders, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
Hinderer of the good, transgressor, malefactor </P>
<P><A NAME="068_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
Greedy therewithal, intrusive. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
It is because he is possessed of wealth and children </P>
<P><A NAME="068_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
That, when Our revelations are recited unto him, he saith: Mere fables of the  men of old. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
We shall brand him on the nose. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
Lo! We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they  vowed that they would pluck its fruit next morning, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
And made no exception (for the Will of Allah); </P>
<P><A NAME="068_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
Then a visitation from thy Lord came upon it while they slept </P>
<P><A NAME="068_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And in the morning it was as if plucked. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And they cried out one unto another in the morning, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
Saying: Run unto your field if ye would pluck (the fruit). </P>
<P><A NAME="068_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
So they went off, saying one unto another in low tones: </P>
<P><A NAME="068_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
No needy man shall enter it to-day against you. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
They went betimes, strong in (this) purpose. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
But when they saw it, they said: Lo! we are in error! </P>
<P><A NAME="068_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
Nay, but we are desolate! </P>
<P><A NAME="068_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
The best among them said: Said I not unto you: Why glorify ye not (Allah) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
They said: Glorified be our Lord! Lo! we have been wrong-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Then some of them drew near unto others, self-reproaching. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
They said: Alas for us! In truth we were outrageous. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
It may be that our Lord will give us better than this in place thereof. Lo! we  beseech our Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
Such was the punishment. And verily the punishment of the Hereafter is  greater if they did but know. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
Lo! for those who keep from evil are gardens of bliss with their Lord. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Shall We then treat those who have surrendered as We treat the guilty ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
What aileth you ? How foolishly ye judge! </P>
<P><A NAME="068_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
Or have ye a scripture wherein ye learn </P>
<P><A NAME="068_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
That ye shall indeed have all that ye choose ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
Or have ye a covenant on oath from Us that reacheth to the Day of Judgment,  that yours shall be all that ye ordain ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
Ask them (O Muhammad) which of them will vouch for that! </P>
<P><A NAME="068_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
Or have they other gods ? Then let them bring their other gods if they are  truthful </P>
<P><A NAME="068_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
On the day when it befalleth in earnest, and they are ordered to prostrate  themselves but are not able, </P>
<P><A NAME="068_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
With eyes downcast, abasement stupefying them. And they had been  summoned to prostrate themselves while they were yet unhurt. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
Leave Me (to deal) with those who give the lie to this pronouncement. We  shall lead them on by steps from whence they know not. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
Yet I bear with them, for lo! My scheme is firm. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
Or dost thou (Muhammad) ask a fee from them so that they are heavily taxed  ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
Or is the Unseen theirs that they can write (thereof) ? </P>
<P><A NAME="068_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
But wait thou for thy Lord's decree, and be not like him of the fish, who cried  out in despair. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
Had it not been that favour from his Lord had reached him he surely had  been cast into the wilderness while he was reprobate. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
But his Lord chose him and placed him among the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="068_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And lo! those who disbelieve would fain disconcert thee with their eyes  when they hear the Reminder, and they say: Lo! he is indeed mad; </P>
<P><A NAME="068_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
When it is naught else than a Reminder to creation. <HR>
