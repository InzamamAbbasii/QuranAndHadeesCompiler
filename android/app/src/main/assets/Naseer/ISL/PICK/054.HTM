<P><A NAME="054_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
The hour drew nigh and the moon was rent in twain. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
And if they behold a portent they turn away and say: Prolonged illusion. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
They denied (the Truth) and followed their own lusts. Yet everything will  come to a decision </P>
<P><A NAME="054_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And surely there hath come unto them news whereof the purport should  deter, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Effective wisdom; but warnings avail not. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
So withdraw from them (O Muhammad) on the day when the Summoner  summoneth unto a painful thing. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
With downcast eyes, they come forth from the graves as they were locusts  spread abroad, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Hastening toward the summoner; the disbelievers say: This is a hard day. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
The folk of Noah denied before them, yea, they denied Our slave and said: A  madman; and he was repulsed. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
So he cried unto his Lord, saying: I am vanquished, so give help. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Then opened We the gates of heaven with pouring water </P>
<P><A NAME="054_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
And caused the earth to gush forth springs, so that the waters met for a  predestined purpose. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
And We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
That ran (upon the waters) in Our sight, as a reward for him who was  rejected. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
And verily We left it as a token; but is there any that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
(The tribe of) A'ad rejected warnings. Then how (dreadful) was My  punishment after My warnings. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant calamity, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
Sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm-trees. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
(The tribe of) Thamud rejected warnings </P>
<P><A NAME="054_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
For they said; Is it a mortal man, alone among us, that we are to follow ?  Then indeed we should fall into error and madness. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
Hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us ? Nay, but he is  a rash liar. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
(Unto their warner it was said): To-morrow they will know who is the rash  liar. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
Lo! We are sending the she-camel as a test for them; so watch them and have  patience; </P>
<P><A NAME="054_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them.  Every drinking will be witnessed. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
But they call their comrade and he took and hamstrung (her). </P>
<P><A NAME="054_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
Lo! We sent upon them one Shout, and they became as the dry twigs  (rejected by) the builder of a cattle-fold. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
The folk of Lot rejected warnings. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
Lo! We sent a storm of stones upon them (all) save the family of Lot, whom  We rescued in the last watch of the night, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who giveth thanks. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
And he indeed had warned them of Our blow, but they did doubt the  warnings. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
They even asked of him his guests for an ill purpose. Then We blinded their  eyes (and said): Taste now My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
And in truth the punishment decreed befell them early in the morning. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
Now taste My punishment after My warnings! </P>
<P><A NAME="054_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
And in truth We have made the Qur'an easy to remember; but is there any  that remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
And warnings came in truth unto the house of Pharaoh </P>
<P><A NAME="054_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Who denied Our revelations, every one. Therefore We grasped them with the  grasp of the Mighty, the Powerful. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
Are your disbelievers better than those, or have ye some immunity in the  scriptures ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
Or say they: We are a host victorious ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
The hosts will all be routed and will turn and flee. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
Nay, but the Hour (of doom) is their appointed tryst, and the Hour will be  more wretched and more bitter (than their earthly failure). </P>
<P><A NAME="054_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
Lo! the guilty are in error and madness. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
On the day when they are dragged into the Fire upon their faces (it is said  unto them): Feel the touch of hell. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
Lo! We have created every thing by measure. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
And Our commandment is but one (commandment), as the twinkling of an  eye. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And verily We have destroyed your fellows; but is there any that  remembereth ? </P>
<P><A NAME="054_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
And every thing they did is in the scriptures, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
And every small and great thing is recorded. </P>
<P><A NAME="054_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
Lo! the righteous will dwell among gardens and rivers, </P>
<P><A NAME="054_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
Firmly established in the favour of a Mighty King. <HR>
