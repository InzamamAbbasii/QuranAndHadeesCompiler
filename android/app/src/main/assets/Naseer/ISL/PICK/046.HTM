Ha. Mim. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
The revelation of the Scripture is from Allah the Mighty, the Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them save  with truth, and for a term appointed. But those who disbelieve turn away from that  whereof they are warned. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Have ye thought on all that ye invoke  beside Allah ? Show me what they have created of the earth. Or have they any portion  in the heavens ? Bring me a scripture before this (Scripture), or some vestige of  knowledge (in support of what ye say), if ye are truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
And who is further astray than those who, instead of Allah, pray unto such as  hear not their prayer until the Day of Resurrection, and are unconscious of their  prayer, </P>
<P><A NAME="046_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
And when mankind are gathered (to the Judgment) will become enemies for  them, and will become deniers of having been worshipped. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve  say of the Truth when it reacheth them: This is mere magic. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Or say they: He hath invented it ? Say (O Muhammad): If I have invented it,  still ye have no power to support me against Allah. He is Best Aware of what ye say  among yourselves concerning it. He sufficeth for a witness between me and you. And  He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Say: I am no new thing among the messengers (of Allah), nor know I what  will be done with me or with you. I do but follow that which is inspired in me, and I  am but a plain warner. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Bethink you: If it is from Allah and ye disbelieve therein, and a witness of  the Children of Israel hath already testified to the like thereof and hath believed, and  ye are too proud (what plight is yours) ? Lo! Allah guideth not wrong-doing folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
And those who disbelieve say of those who believe: If it had been (any)  good, they would not have been before us in attaining it. And since they will not be  guided by it, they say: This is an ancient lie; </P>
<P><A NAME="046_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
When before it there was the Scripture of Moses, an example and a mercy;  and this is a confirming Scripture in the Arabic language, that it may warn those who  do wrong and bring good tidings for the righteous. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
Lo! those who say: Our Lord is Allah, and thereafter walk aright, there shall  no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
Such are rightful owners of the Garden, immortal therein, as a reward for  what they used to do. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
And We have commended unto man kindness toward parents. His mother  beareth him with reluctance, and bringeth him forth with reluctance, and the bearing  of him and the weaning of him is thirty months, till, when he attaineth full strength  and reacheth forty years, he saith: My Lord! Arouse me that I may give thanks for the  favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents, and that I may do right  acceptable unto Thee. And be gracious unto me in the matter of my seed. Lo! I have  turned unto Thee repentant, and lo! I am of those who surrender (unto Thee). </P>
<P><A NAME="046_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Those are they from whom We accept the best of what they do, and overlook  their evil deeds. (They are) among the owners of the Garden. This is the true promise  which they were promised (in the world). </P>
<P><A NAME="046_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And whoso saith unto his parents: Fie upon you both! Do ye threaten me that  I shall be brought forth (again) when generations before me have passed away ? And  they twain cry unto Allah for help (and say): Woe unto thee! Believe! Lo! the promise  of Allah is true. But he saith: This is naught save fables of the men of old: </P>
<P><A NAME="046_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
Such are those on whom the Word concerning nations of the jinn and  mankind which have passed away before them hath effect. Lo! they are the losers. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And for all there will be ranks from what they do, that He may pay them for  their deeds; and they will not be wronged. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire (it will be  said): Ye squandered your good things in the life of the world and sought comfort  therein. Now this day ye are rewarded with the doom of ignominy because ye were  disdainful in the land without a right, and because ye used to transgress. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And make mention (O Muhammad) of the brother of A'ad when he warned  his folk among the wind-curved sandhills - and verily warners came and went before  and after him - saying: Serve none but Allah. Lo! I fear for you the doom of a  tremendous Day. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
They said: Hast come to turn us away from our gods ? Then bring upon us  that wherewith thou threatenest us, if thou art of the truthful. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
He said: The knowledge is with Allah only. I convey unto you that  wherewith I have been sent, but I see you are a folk that know not. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
Then, when they beheld it as a dense cloud coming toward their valleys, they  said: Here is a cloud bringing us rain. Nay, but it is that which ye did seek to hasten, a  wind wherein is painful torment, </P>
<P><A NAME="046_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
Destroying all things by commandment of its Lord. And morning found them  so that naught could be seen save their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And verily We had empowered them with that wherewith We have not  empowered you, and had assigned them ears and eyes and hearts; but their ears and  eyes and hearts availed them naught since they denied the revelations of Allah; and  what they used to mock befell them. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
And verily We have destroyed townships round about you, and displayed  (for them) Our revelation, that haply they might return. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
Then why did those whom they had chosen for gods as a way of approach  (unto Allah) not help them ? Nay, but they did fail them utterly. And (all) that was  their lie, and what they used to invent. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
And when We inclined toward thee (Muhammad) certain of the jinn, who  wished to hear the Qur'an and, when they were in its presence, said: Give ear! and,  when it was finished, turned back to their people, warning. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
They said: O our people! Lo! we have heard a scripture which hath been  revealed after Moses, confirming that which was before it, guiding unto the truth and  a right road. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
O our people! respond to Allah's summoner and believe in Him. He will  forgive you some of your sins and guard you from a painful doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And whoso respondeth not to Allah's summoner he can nowise escape in the  earth, and he hath no protecting friends instead of Him. Such are in error manifest. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
Have they not seen that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and  was not wearied by their creation, is Able to give life to the dead ? Aye, He verily is  Able to do all things. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
And on the day when those who disbelieve are exposed to the Fire (they will  be asked): Is not this real ? They will say: Yea, by our Lord. He will say: Then taste  the doom for that ye disbelieved. </P>
<P><A NAME="046_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
Then have patience (O Muhammad) even as the stout of heart among the  messengers (of old) had patience, and seek not to hasten on (the doom) for them. On  the day when they see that which they are promised (it will seem to them) as though  they had tarried but an hour of daylight. A clear message. Shall any be destroyed save  evil-living folk ? <HR>
