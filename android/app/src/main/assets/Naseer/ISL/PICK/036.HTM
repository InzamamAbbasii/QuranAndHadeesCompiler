Ya Sin. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
By the wise Qur'an, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
Lo! thou art of those sent </P>
<P><A NAME="036_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
On a straight path, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
That thou mayst warn a folk whose fathers were not warned, so they are  heedless. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
Already hath the judgment, (for their infidelity) proved true of most of them,  for they believe not. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Lo! We have put on their necks carcans reaching unto the chins, so that they  are made stiff-necked. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them, and (thus) have  covered them so that they see not. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not, it is alike for them, for they  believe not. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the  Beneficent in secret. To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
Lo! We it is Who bring the dead to life. We record that which they send  before (them, and their footprints. And all things We have kept in a clear Register. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
Coin for them a similitude: The people of the city when those sent (from  Allah) came unto them; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
When We sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We  reinforced them with a third, and they said: Lo! we have been sent unto you. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
They said: Ye are but mortals like unto us. The Beneficent hath naught  revealed. Ye do but lie! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And our duty is but plain conveyance (of the message). </P>
<P><A NAME="036_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
(The people of the city) said: We augur ill of you. If ye desist not, we shall  surely stone you, and grievous torture will befall you at our hands. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
They said: Your evil augury be with you! Is it because ye are reminded (of  the truth) ? Nay, but ye are froward folk! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running. He cried:  O my people! Follow those who have been sent! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
Follow those who ask of you no fee, and who are rightly guided. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto  Whom ye will be brought back ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
Shall I take (other) gods in place of Him when, if the Beneficent should wish  me any harm, their intercession will avail me naught, nor can they save ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
Then truly I should be in error manifest. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
Lo! I have believed in your Lord, so hear me! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
It was said (unto him): Enter paradise. He said: Would that my people knew </P>
<P><A NAME="036_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
With what (munificence) my Lord hath pardoned me and made me of the  honoured ones! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do  We ever send. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
It was but one Shout, and lo! they were extinct. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger  but they did mock him! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which  indeed returned not unto them; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
But all, without exception, will be brought before Us. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from it  grain so that they eat thereof; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We  have caused springs of water to gush forth therein, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they  not, then, give thanks ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth  groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in  darkness. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of  the Mighty, the Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old  shrivelled palm-leaf. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day.  They float each in an orbit. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
And have created for them of the like thereof whereon they ride. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
And if We will, We drown them, and there is no help for them, neither can  they be saved; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
Unless by mercy from Us and as comfort for a while. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
When it is said unto them: Beware of that which is before you and that which  is behind you, that haply ye may find mercy (they are heedless). </P>
<P><A NAME="036_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
Never came a token of the tokens of their Lord to them, but they did turn  away from it! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
And when it is said unto them: Spend of that wherewith Allah hath provided  you, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Shall we feed those whom  Allah, if He willed, would feed ? Ye are in naught else than error manifest. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
They await but one Shout, which will surprise them while they are disputing. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
Then they cannot make bequest, nor can they return to their own folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And the trumpet is blown and lo! from the graves they hie unto their Lord, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
Crying: Woe upon us! Who hath raised us from our place of sleep ? This is  that which the Beneficent did promise, and the messengers spoke truth. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
It is but one Shout, and behold them brought together before Us! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
This day no soul is wronged in aught; nor are ye requited aught save what ye  used to do. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
Lo! those who merit paradise this day are happily employed, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
They and their wives, in pleasant shade, on thrones reclining; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
Theirs the fruit (of their good deeds) and theirs (all) that they ask; </P>
<P><A NAME="036_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
The word from a Merciful Lord (for them) is: Peace! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day! </P>
<P><A NAME="036_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
Did I not charge you, O ye sons of Adam, that ye worship not the devil - Lo!  he is your open foe! - </P>
<P><A NAME="036_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
But that ye worship Me ? That was the right path. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
Yet he hath led astray of you a great multitude. Had ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
This is hell which ye were promised (if ye followed him). </P>
<P><A NAME="036_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
Burn therein this day for that ye disbelieved. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
This day We seal up their mouths, and their hands speak out to Us and their  feet bear witness as to what they used to earn. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
And had We willed, We verily could have quenched their eyesight so that  they should struggle for the way. Then how could they have seen ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
And had We willed, We verily could have fixed them in their place, making  them powerless to go forward or turn back. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
He whom we bring unto old age, We reverse him in creation (making him go  back to weakness after strength). Have ye then no sense ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
And We have not taught him (Muhammad) poetry, nor is it meet for him.  This is naught else than a Reminder and a Lecture making plain, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
To warn whosoever liveth, and that the word may be fulfilled against the  disbelievers. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
Have they not seen how We have created for them of Our handiwork the  cattle, so that they are their owners, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
And have subdued them unto them, so that some of them they have for  riding, some for food ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
Benefits and (divers) drinks have they from them. Will they not then give  thanks ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
And they have taken (other) gods beside Allah, in order that they may be  helped. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
It is not in their power to help them; but they (the worshippers) are unto them  a host in arms. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
So let not their speech grieve thee (O Muhammad). Lo! We know what they  conceal and what proclaim. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
Hath not man seen that We have created him from a drop of seed ? Yet lo! he  is an open opponent. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
And he hath coined for Us a similitude, and hath forgotten the fact of his  creation, saying: Who will revive these bones when they have rotted away ? </P>
<P><A NAME="036_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
Say: He will revive them Who produced them at the first, for He is Knower  of every creation, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
Who hath appointed for you fire from the green tree, and behold! ye kindle  from it. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the like of  them ? Aye, that He is! for He is the All-Wise Creator, </P>
<P><A NAME="036_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
But His command, when He intendeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it:  Be! and it is. </P>
<P><A NAME="036_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
Therefor Glory be to Him in Whose hand is the dominion over all things!  Unto Him ye will be brought back. <HR>
