<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">59. al-Hashr: The Exile</H1>
<P><A NAME="059_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
All that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth glorifieth Allah, and He is  the Mighty, the Wise. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who  disbelieved to go forth from their homes unto the first exile. Ye deemed not that they  would go forth, while they deemed that their strongholds would protect them from  Allah.  But Allah reached them from a place whereof they recked not, and cast terror  in their hearts so that they ruined their houses with their own hands and the hands of  the believers. So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes! </P>
<P><A NAME="059_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
And if Allah had not decreed migration for them, He verily would have  punished them in the world, and theirs in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
That is because they were opposed to Allah and His messenger; and whoso is  opposed to Allah, (for him) verily Allah is stern in reprisal. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Whatsoever palm-trees ye cut down or left standing on their roots, it was by  Allah's leave, in order that He might confound the evil-livers. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
And that which Allah gave as spoil unto His messenger from them, ye urged  not any horse or riding-camel for the sake thereof, but Allah giveth His messenger  lordship over whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
That which Allah giveth as spoil unto His messenger from the people of the  townships, it is for Allah and His messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans  and the needy and the wayfarer, that it become not a commodity between the rich  among you. And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he  forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in  reprisal. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
And (it is) for the poor fugitives who have been driven out from their homes  and their belongings, who seek bounty from Allah and help Allah and His messenger.  They are the loyal. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Those who entered the city and the faith before them love those who flee  unto them for refuge, and find in their breasts no need for that which hath been given  them, but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot.  And whoso is saved from his own avarice - such are they who are successful. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
And those who came (into the faith) after them say: Our Lord! Forgive us  and our brethren who were before us in the faith, and place not in our hearts any  rancour toward those who believe. Our Lord! Thou art Full of Pity, Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
Hast thou not observed those who are hypocrites, (how) they tell their  brethren who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture: If ye are driven out, we  surely will go out with you, and we will never obey anyone against you, and if ye are  attacked we verily will help you. And Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
(For) indeed if they are driven out they go not out with them, and indeed if  they are attacked they help them not, and indeed if they had helped them they would  have turned and fled, and then they would not have been victorious. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
Ye are more awful as a fear in their bosoms than Allah. That is because they  are a folk who understand not. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
They will not fight against you in a body save in fortified villages or from  behind walls. Their adversity among themselves is very great. Ye think of them as a  whole whereas their hearts are divers. That is because they are a folk who have no  sense. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
On the likeness of those (who suffered) a short time before them, they taste  the ill-effects of their own conduct, and theirs is painful punishment. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
(And the hypocrites are) on the likeness of the devil when he telleth man to  disbelieve, then, when he disbelieveth saith: Lo! I am quit of thee. Lo! I fear Allah,  the Lord of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And the consequence for both will be that they are in the Fire, therein  abiding. Such is the reward of evil-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah. And let every soul look to  that which it sendeth on before for the morrow. And observe your duty to Allah. Lo!  Allah is Informed of what ye do. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And be not ye as those who forgot Allah, therefor He caused them to forget  their souls. Such are the evil-doers. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
Not equal are the owners of the Fire and the owners of the Garden. The  owners of the Garden, they are the victorious. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
If We had caused this Qur'an to descend upon a mountain, thou (O  Muhammad) verily hadst seen it humbled, rent asunder by the fear of Allah. Such  similitudes coin We for mankind that haply they may reflect. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
He is Allah, than Whom there is no other God, the Knower of the Invisible  and the Visible. He is the Beneficent, Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="059_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
He is Allah, than Whom there is no other God, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy  One, Peace, the Keeper of Faith, the Guardian, the Majestic, the Compeller, the  Superb. Glorified be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him). </P>
<P><A NAME="059_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
He is Allah, the Creator, the Shaper out of naught, the Fashioner. His are the  most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifieth Him, and He  is the Mighty, the Wise. <HR>
