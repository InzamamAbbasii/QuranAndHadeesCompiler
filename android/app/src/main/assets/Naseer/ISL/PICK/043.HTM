<P><A NAME="043_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Ha. Mim. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
By the Scripture which maketh plain, </P>
<P><A NAME="043_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
Lo! We have appointed it a Lecture, in Arabic that haply ye may understand. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
And Lo! in the Source of Decrees, which We possess, it is indeed sublime,  decisive. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
Shall We utterly ignore you because ye are a wanton folk ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
How many a prophet did We send among the men of old! </P>
<P><A NAME="043_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
And never came there unto them a prophet but they used to mock him. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
Then We destroyed men mightier than these in prowess; and the example of  the men of old hath gone (before them). </P>
<P><A NAME="043_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
And if thou (Muhammad) ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth,  they will surely answer: The Mighty, the Knower created them; </P>
<P><A NAME="043_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and placed roads for you therein,  that haply ye may find your way; </P>
<P><A NAME="043_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
And Who sendeth down water from the sky in (due) measure, and We revive  a dead land therewith. Even so will ye be brought forth; </P>
<P><A NAME="043_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
He Who created all the pairs, and appointed for you ships and cattle  whereupon ye ride. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
That ye may mount upon their backs, and may remember your Lord's favour  when ye mount thereon, and may say: Glorified be He Who hath subdued these unto  us, and we were not capable (of subduing them); </P>
<P><A NAME="043_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
And lo! unto our Lord we surely are returning. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
And they allot to Him a portion of His bondmen! Lo! man is verily a mere  ingrate. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
Or chooseth He daughters of all that He hath created, and honoureth He you  with sons ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And if one of them hath tidings of that which he likeneth to the Beneficent  One, his countenance becometh black and he is full of inward rage. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
(Liken they then to Allah) that which is bred up in outward show, and in  dispute cannot make itself plain ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And they make the angels, who are the slaves of the Beneficent, females. Did  they witness their creation ? Their testimony will be recorded and they will be  questioned. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And they say: If the Beneficent One had (so) willed, we should not have  worshipped them. They have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They do but guess. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
Or have We given them any scripture before (this Qur'an) so that they are  holding fast thereto ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
Nay, for they say only: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion, and we  are guided by their footprints. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
And even so We sent not a warner before thee (Muhammad) into any  township but its luxurious ones said: Lo! we found our fathers following a religion,  and we are following their footprints. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
(And the warner) said: What! Even though I bring you better guidance than  that ye found your fathers following ? They answered: Lo! in what ye bring we are  disbelievers. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
So We requited them. Then see the nature of the consequence for the  rejecters! </P>
<P><A NAME="043_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And when Abraham said unto his father and his folk: Lo! I am innocent of  what ye worship </P>
<P><A NAME="043_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
Save Him Who did create me, for He will surely guide me. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
And he made it a word enduring among his seed, that haply they might  return. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
Nay, but I let these and their fathers enjoy life (only) till there should come  unto them the Truth and a messenger making plain. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
And now that the Truth hath come unto them they say: This is mere magic,  and lo! we are disbelievers therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
And they say: If only this Qur'an had been revealed to some great man of the  two towns ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
Is it they who apportion thy Lord's mercy ? We have apportioned among  them their livelihood in the life of the world, and raised some of them above others in  rank that some of them may take labour from others; and the mercy of thy Lord is  better than (the wealth) that they amass. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
And were it not that mankind would have become one community, We might  well have appointed, for those who disbelieve in the Beneficent, roofs of silver for  their houses and stairs (of silver) whereby to mount, </P>
<P><A NAME="043_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
And for their houses doors (of silver) and couches of silver whereon to  recline, </P>
<P><A NAME="043_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
And ornaments of gold. Yet all that would have been but a provision of the  life of the world. And the Hereafter with your Lord would have been for those who  keep from evil. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
And he whose sight is dim to the remembrance of the Beneficent, We assign  unto him a devil who becometh his comrade; </P>
<P><A NAME="043_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
And lo! they surely turn them from the way of Allah, and yet they deem that  they are rightly guided; </P>
<P><A NAME="043_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
Till, when he cometh unto Us, he saith (unto his comrade): Ah, would that  between me and thee there were the distance of the two horizons - an evil comrade! </P>
<P><A NAME="043_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
And it profiteth you not this day, because ye did wrong, that ye will be  sharers in the doom. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
Canst thou (Muhammad) make the deaf to hear, or canst thou guide the blind  or him who is in error manifest ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
And if We take thee away, We surely shall take vengeance on them, </P>
<P><A NAME="043_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Or (if) We show thee that wherewith We threaten them; for lo! We have  complete command of them. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
So hold thou fast to that which is inspired in thee. Lo! thou art on a right  path. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
And lo! it is in truth a Reminder for thee and for thy folk; and ye will be  questioned. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
And ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before thee: Did We ever  appoint gods to be worshipped beside the Beneficent ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations unto Pharaoh and his chiefs,  and he said: I am a messenger of the Lord of the Worlds. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
But when he brought them Our tokens, behold! they laughed at them. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
And every token that We showed them was greater than its sister (token),  and We grasped them with the torment, that haply they might turn again. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
And they said: O wizard! Entreat thy Lord for us by the pact that He hath  made with thee. Lo! we verily will walk aright. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
But when We eased them of the torment, behold! they broke their word. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
And Pharaoh caused a proclamation to be made among his people saying: O  my people! Is not mine the sovereignty of Egypt and these rivers flowing under me ?  Can ye not then discern ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
I am surely better than this fellow, who is despicable and can hardly make  (his meaning) plain! </P>
<P><A NAME="043_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
Why, then, have armlets of gold not been set upon him, or angels sent along  with him ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
Thus he persuaded his people to make light (of Moses), and they obeyed  him. Lo! they were a wanton folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
So, when they angered Us, We punished them and drowned them every one. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
And We made them a thing past, and an example for those after (them). </P>
<P><A NAME="043_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
And when the son of Mary is quoted as an example, behold! the folk laugh  out, </P>
<P><A NAME="043_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
And say: Are our gods better, or is he ? They raise not the objection save for  argument. Nay! but they are a contentious folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
He is nothing but a slave on whom We bestowed favour, and We made him a  pattern for the Children of Israel. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_060"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT>
And had We willed We could have set among you angels to be viceroys in  the earth. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_061"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT>
And lo! verily there is knowledge of the Hour. So doubt ye not concerning it,  but follow Me. This is the right path. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_062"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT>
And let not Satan turn you aside. Lo! he is an open enemy for you. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_063"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT>
When Jesus came with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty), he said: I have  come unto you with wisdom, and to make plain some of that concerning which ye  differ. So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_064"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT>
Lo! Allah, He is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is a right  path. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_065"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT>
But the factions among them differed. Then woe unto those who do wrong  from the doom of a painful day. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_066"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT>
Await they aught save the Hour, that it shall come upon them suddenly,  when they know not ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_067"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT>
Friends on that day will be foes one to another, save those who kept their  duty (to Allah). </P>
<P><A NAME="043_068"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT>
O My slaves! For you there is no fear this day, nor is it ye who grieve; </P>
<P><A NAME="043_069"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT>
(Ye) who believed Our revelations and were self-surrendered, </P>
<P><A NAME="043_070"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT>
Enter the Garden, ye and your wives, to be made glad. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_071"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT>
Therein are brought round for them trays of gold and goblets, and therein is  all that souls desire and eyes find sweet. And ye are immortal therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_072"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT>
This is the Garden which ye are made to inherit because of what ye used to  do. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_073"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT>
Therein for you is fruit in plenty whence to eat. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_074"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT>
Lo! the guilty are immortal in hell's torment. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_075"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT>
It is not relaxed for them, and they despair therein. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_076"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT>
We wronged them not, but they it was who did the wrong. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_077"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT>
And they cry: O master! Let thy Lord make an end of us. He saith: Lo! here  ye must remain. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_078"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT>
We verily brought the Truth unto you, but ye were, most of you, averse to  the Truth. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_079"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT>
Or do they determine any thing (against the Prophet) ? Lo! We (also) are  determining. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_080"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT>
Or deem they that We cannot hear their secret thoughts and private  confidences ? Nay, but Our envoys, present with them, do record. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_081"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT>
Say (O Muhammad): If the Beneficent One hath a son, then, I shall be first  among the worshippers. (But there is no son). </P>
<P><A NAME="043_082"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT>
Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne,  from that which they ascribe (unto Him)! </P>
<P><A NAME="043_083"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT>
So let them flounder (in their talk) and play until they meet the Day which  they are promised. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_084"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT>
And He it is Who in the heaven is God, and in the earth God. He is the Wise,  the Knower. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_085"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT>
And blessed be He unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and  the earth and all that is between them, and with Whom is knowledge of the Hour, and  unto Whom ye will be returned. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_086"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT>
And those unto whom they cry instead of Him possess no power of  intercession, saving him who beareth witness unto the Truth knowingly. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_087"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT>
And if thou ask them who created them, they will surely say: Allah. How  then are they turned away ? </P>
<P><A NAME="043_088"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT>
And he saith: O my Lord! Lo! these are a folk who believe not. </P>
<P><A NAME="043_089"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT>
Then bear with them (O Muhammad) and say: Peace. But they will come to  know. <HR>
