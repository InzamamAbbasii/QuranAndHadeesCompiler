<P><A NAME="044_001"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT>
Ha. Mim. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_002"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT>
By the Scripture that maketh plain </P>
<P><A NAME="044_003"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT>
Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning - </P>
<P><A NAME="044_004"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT>
Whereon every wise command is made clear </P>
<P><A NAME="044_005"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT>
As a command from Our presence - Lo! We are ever sending - </P>
<P><A NAME="044_006"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT>
A mercy from thy Lord. Lo! He, even He is the Hearer, the Knower, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_007"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT>
Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye would  be sure. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_008"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT>
There is no God save Him. He quickeneth and giveth death; your Lord and  Lord of your forefathers. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_009"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT>
Nay, but they play in doubt. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_010"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT>
But watch thou (O Muhammad) for the day when the sky will produce  visible smoke </P>
<P><A NAME="044_011"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT>
That will envelop the people. This will be a painful torment. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_012"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT>
(Then they will say): Our Lord relieve us of the torment. Lo! we are  believers. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_013"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT>
How can there be remembrance for them, when a messenger making plain  (the Truth) had already come unto them, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_014"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT>
And they had turned away from him and said: One taught (by others), a  madman ? </P>
<P><A NAME="044_015"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT>
Lo! We withdraw the torment a little. Lo! ye return (to disbelief). </P>
<P><A NAME="044_016"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT>
On the day when We shall seize them with the greater seizure, (then) in truth  We shall punish. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_017"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT>
And verily We tried before them Pharaoh's folk, when there came unto them  a noble messenger, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_018"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT>
Saying: Give up to me the slaves of Allah. Lo! I am a faithful messenger  unto you. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_019"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT>
And saying: Be not proud against Allah. Lo! I bring you a clear warrant. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_020"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT>
And lo! I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord lest ye stone me to  death. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_021"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT>
And if ye put no faith in me, then let me go. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_022"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT>
And he cried unto his Lord, (saying): These are guilty folk. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_023"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT>
Then (his Lord commanded): Take away My slaves by night. Lo! ye will be  followed, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_024"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT>
And leave the sea behind at rest, for lo! they are a drowned host. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_025"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT>
How many were the gardens and the watersprings that they left behind, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_026"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT>
And the cornlands and the goodly sites </P>
<P><A NAME="044_027"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT>
And pleasant things wherein they took delight! </P>
<P><A NAME="044_028"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT>
Even so (it was), and We made it an inheritance for other folk; </P>
<P><A NAME="044_029"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT>
And the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_030"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT>
And We delivered the Children of Israel from the shameful doom; </P>
<P><A NAME="044_031"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT>
(We delivered them) from Pharaoh. Lo! he was a tyrant of the wanton ones. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_032"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT>
And We chose them, purposely, above (all) creatures. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_033"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT>
And We gave them portents wherein was a clear trial. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_034"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT>
Lo! these, forsooth, are saying: </P>
<P><A NAME="044_035"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT>
There is naught but our first death, and we shall not be raised again. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_036"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT>
Bring back our fathers, if ye speak the truth! </P>
<P><A NAME="044_037"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT>
Are they better, or the folk of Tubb'a and those before them ? We destroyed  them, for surely they were guilty. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_038"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT>
And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them,  in play. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_039"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT>
We created them not save with truth; but most of them know not. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_040"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT>
Assuredly the Day of Decision is the term for all of them, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_041"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT>
A day when friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_042"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT>
Save him on whom Allah hath mercy. Lo! He is the Mighty, the Merciful. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_043"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT>
Lo! the tree of Zaqqum, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_044"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT>
The food of the sinner! </P>
<P><A NAME="044_045"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT>
Like molten brass, it seetheth in their bellies </P>
<P><A NAME="044_046"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT>
As the seething of boiling water. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_047"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT>
(And it will be said): Take him and drag him to the midst of hell, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_048"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT>
Then pour upon his head the torment of boiling water. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_049"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT>
(Saying): Taste! Lo! thou wast forsooth the mighty, the noble! </P>
<P><A NAME="044_050"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT>
Lo! this is that whereof ye used to doubt. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_051"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT>
Lo! those who kept their duty will be in a place secured. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_052"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT>
Amid gardens and watersprings, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_053"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT>
Attired in silk and silk embroidery, facing one another. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_054"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT>
Even so (it will be). And We shall wed them unto fair ones with wide, lovely  eyes. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_055"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT>
They call therein for every fruit in safety. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_056"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT>
They taste not death therein, save the first death. And He hath saved them  from the doom of hell, </P>
<P><A NAME="044_057"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT>
A bounty from thy Lord. That is the supreme triumph. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_058"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT>
And We have made (this Scripture) easy in thy language only that they may  heed. </P>
<P><A NAME="044_059"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT>
Wait then (O Muhammad). Lo! they (too) are waiting. <HR>
