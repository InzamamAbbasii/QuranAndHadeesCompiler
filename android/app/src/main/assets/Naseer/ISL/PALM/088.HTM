<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE OVERWHELMING</P><DIR>

<P>(LXXXVIII. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>Has there come to thee the story of the overwhelming? Faces on that day shall be humble, labouring, toiling,- shall broil upon a burning fire; shall be given to drink from a boiling spring! no food shall they have save from the foul thorn, which shall not fatten nor avail against hunger!</P>
<P>Faces on that day shall be comfortable, content with their past endeavours,-in a lofty garden wherein they shall hear no foolish word; wherein is a flowing fountain; wherein are couches raised on high, and goblets set down, and cushions arranged, and carpets spread! Do they not look then at the camel how she is created?</P>
<P>And at the heaven how it is reared?</P>
<P>And at the mountains how they are set up?</P>
<P>And at the earth how it is spread out?</P>
<P>But remind: thou art only one to remind; thou art not in authority over them; except such as turns his back and misbelieves, for him will God torment with the greatest torment.</P>
<P>Verily, unto us is their return, and, verily, for us is their account!</P>
