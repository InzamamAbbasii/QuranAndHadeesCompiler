<P>THE CHAPTER OF CONGEALED BLOOD</P><DIR>

<P>(XCVI. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>READ, in the name of thy Lord!</P>
<P>Who created man from congealed blood!</P>
<P>Read, for thy Lord is most generous!</P>
<P>Who taught the pen!</P>
<P>Taught man what he did not know!</P>
<P>Nay, verily, man is indeed outrageous at seeing himself get rich!</P>
<P>Verily, unto thy Lord is the return!</P>
<P>Hast thou considered him who forbids a servant when he prays?</P>
<P>Hast thou considered if he were in guidance or bade piety?</P>
<P>Hast thou considered if he said it was a lie, and turned his back?</P>
<P>Did he not know that God can see?</P>
<P>Nay, surely, if he do not desist we will drag him by the forelock!-the lying sinful forelock!</P>
<P>So let him call his counsel: we will call the guards of hell!</P>
<P>Nay, obey him not, but adore and draw nigh!</P>
