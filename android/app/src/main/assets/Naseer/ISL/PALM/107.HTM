<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE ‘NECESSARIES’</P><DIR>

<P>(CVII. Place of origin doubtful.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Hast thou considered him who calls the judgment a lie? He it is who pushes the orphan away; and urges not (others) to feed the poor. But woe to those who pray and who are careless in their prayers, Who pretend and withhold necessaries.</P>
