<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE SUN</P><DIR>

<P>(XCI. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>By the sun and its noonday brightness!</P>
<P>And the moon when it follows him!</P>
<P>And the day when it displays him!</P>
<P>And the night when it covers him!</P>
<P>And the heaven and what built it!</P>
<P>And the earth and what spread it!</P>
<P>And the soul and what fashioned it, and taught it</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>its sin and its piety!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Prosperous is he who purifies it!</P>
<P>And disappointed is he who corrupts it!</P>
<P>Thamud called the apostle a liar in their outrage, when their wretch rose up and the apostle of God said to them, ‘God’s she-camel! so give her to drink.’</P>
<P>But they called him a liar, and they ham-strung her; but their Lord destroyed them in their sins, and served them all alike; and He fears not the result thereof!</P>
