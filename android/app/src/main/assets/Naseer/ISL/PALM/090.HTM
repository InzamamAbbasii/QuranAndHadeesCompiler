<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE LAND</P><DIR>

<P>(XC. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God. I need not swear by the Lord of this land, and though a dweller in this land!</P>
<P>Nor by the begetter and what he begets!</P>
<P>We have surely created man in trouble.</P>
<P>Does he think that none can do aught against him? He says, I have wasted wealth in plenty;’ does he think that no one sees him?</P>
<P>Have we not made for him two eyes and a tongue, and two lips? and guided him in the two highways? but he will not attempt the steep! And what shall make thee know what the steep is? It is freeing captives, or feeding on the day of famine, an orphan who is akin, or a poor man who lies in the dust; and again (it is) to be of these who believe and encourage each other to patience, and encourage each other to mercy,-these are the fellows of the right!</P>
<P>But those who disbelieve in our signs, they are the fellows of the left, for them is fire that closes in!</P>
