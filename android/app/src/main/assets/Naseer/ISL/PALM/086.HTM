<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE NIGHT STAR</P><DIR>

<P>(LXXXVI. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God. By the heaven and by the night star! And what shall make thee know what the night star is?- The star of piercing brightness. Verily, every soul has a guardian over it.</P>
<P>Then let man look from what he is created: he is created from water poured forth, that comes out from between the loins and the breast bones.</P>
<P>Verily, He is able to send him back again, on the day when the secrets shall be tried, and he shall have no strength nor helper. By the heaven that sends back the rain!</P>
<P>And the earth with its sprouting!</P>
<P>Verily, it is indeed a distinguishing speech, and it is no frivolity!</P>
<P>Verily, they do plot a plot!</P>
<P>But I plot my plot too! let the misbelievers bide; do thou then let them bide awhile!</P>
