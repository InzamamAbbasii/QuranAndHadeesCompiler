<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE SMITING</P><DIR>

<P>(CI. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>The smiting!</P>
<P>What is the smiting?</P>
<P>And what shall make thee know what the smiting is? The day when men shall be like scattered moths; and the mountains shall be like flocks of carded wool!</P>
<P>And as for him whose balance is heavy, he shall be in a well-pleasing life.</P>
<P>But as for him whose balance is light, his dwelling shall be the pit of hell.</P>
<P>And who shall make thee know what it is?- a burning fire!</P>
