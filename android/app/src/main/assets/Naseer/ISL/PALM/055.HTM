<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE MERCIFUL</P><DIR>

<P>(LV. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>The Merciful taught the Koran;</P>
<P>He created man, taught him plain speech.</P>
<P>The sun and the moon have their appointed time;</P>
<P>The herbs and the trees adore;</P>
<P>And the heavens, He raised them and set the balance, that ye should not be outrageous in the balance;</P>
<P>But weigh ye aright, and stint not the balance.</P>
<P>And the earth He has set it for living creatures therein are fruits and palms, with sheaths; and grain with chaff and frequent shoots;</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>He created men of crackling clay like the potters.</P>
<P>And He created the ginn from smokeless fire.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>The Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two wests!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>He has let loose the two seas that meet together; between them is a barrier they cannot pass!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>He brings forth from each pearls both large and small!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>His are the ships which rear aloft in the sea like mountains.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Every one upon it is transient, but the face of thy Lord endowed with majesty and honour shall endure.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Of Him whosoever is in the heaven and the earth does beg; every day He is in (some fresh) business!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>We shall be at leisure for you, O ye two weighty ones!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>O assembly of ginns and mankind! if ye are able to pass through the confines of heaven and earth then pass through them!-ye cannot pass through save by authority!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>There shall be sent against you a flash of fire,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>and molten copper, and ye shall not be helped!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>And when the heaven is rent asunder and become rosy red - (melting) like grease!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>On that day neither man nor ginn shall be asked about his crime!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>The sinners shall be known by their marks, and shall be seized by the forelock and the feet!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>‘This is hell, which the sinners did call it lie! They shall circulate between it and water boiling quite!’</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>But for him who fears the station of his Lord are gardens twain!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Both furnished with branching trees.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>In each are flowing springs.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>In each are, of every fruit, two kinds.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Reclining on beds the linings of which are of brocade, and the fruit of the two gardens within reach to cull.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Therein are maids of modest glances whom no man nor ginn has deflowered before.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>As though they were rubies and pearls.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Is the reward of goodness aught but goodness?</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>And besides these, are gardens twain,</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will be twain deny?</P>
<P>With dark green foliage.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>In each two gushing springs.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>In each fruit and palms and pomegranates.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>In them maidens best and fairest!</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Bright and large-eyed maids kept in their tents.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Whom no man nor ginn has deflowered before them.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets.</P>
<P>Then which of your Lord’s bounties will ye twain deny?</P>
<P>Blessed be the name of thy Lord possessed of majesty and honour!</P>
