<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE MANIFEST SIGN</P><DIR>

<P>(XCVIII. Place of origin doubtful.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Those of the people of the Book and the idolaters who misbelieve did not fall off until there came to them the manifest sign,-An apostle from God reading pure pages wherein are right scriptures:</P>
<P>Nor did those who were given the Book divide into sects until after there came to them the manifest sign.</P>
<P>But they were not bidden aught but to worship God, being sincere in religion unto Him as ‘Hanifs, and to be steadfast in prayer, and to give alms: for that is the standard religion.</P>
<P>Verily, those who disbelieve amongst the people of the Book and the idolaters shall be in the fire of hell, to dwell therein for aye; they are wretched creatures!</P>
<P>Verily, those who believe and act aright, they are the best of creatures; their reward with their Lord is gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; God shall be well pleased with them, and they with Him! that is for him who fears his Lord!</P>
