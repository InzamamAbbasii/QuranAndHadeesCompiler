<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE FIG</P><DIR>

<P>(XCV. Place of origin doubtful.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>By the fig!</P>
<P>And by the olive!</P>
<P>And by Mount Sinai!</P>
<P>And by this safe land!</P>
<P>We have indeed created man in the best of symmetry. Then we will send him back the lowest of the low; save those who believe and act aright; for theirs is a hire that is not grudged.</P>
<P>But what shall make thee call the judgment after this a lie?</P>
<P>Is not God a most just of judges?</P>
