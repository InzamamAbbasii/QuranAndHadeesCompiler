<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE CLEAVING ASUNDER</P><DIR>

<P>(LXXXII. Mecca.)</P>
<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>When the heaven is cleft asunder,</P>
<P>And when the stars are scattered,</P>
<P>And when the seas gush together,</P></DIR>

<P>And when the tombs are turned upside down, The soul shall know what it has sent on or kept back! O man! what has seduced thee concerning thy generous Lord, who created thee, and fashioned thee, and gave thee symmetry, and in what form He pleased composed thee?</P>
<P>Nay, but ye call the judgment a lie! but over you are guardians set,-noble, writing down! they know what ye do! Verily, the righteous are in pleasure, and, verily, the wicked are in hell; they shall broil therein upon the judgment day; nor shall they be absent therefrom!</P>
<P>And what shall make thee know what is the judgment day? Again, what shall make thee know what is the judgment day? a day when no soul shall control aught for another; and the bidding on that day belongs to God!</P>
