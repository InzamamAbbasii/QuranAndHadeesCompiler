<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE EARTHQUAKE</P><DIR>

<P>(XCIX. Place of origin doubtful.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>When the earth shall quake with its quaking! And the earth shall bring forth her burdens, and man shall say, ‘What ails her!’</P>
<P>On that day she shall tell her tidings, because thy Lord inspires her.</P>
<P>On the day when men shall come up in separate bands to show their works: and he who does the weight of an atom of good shall see it! and he who does the weight of an atom of evil shall see it!</P>
