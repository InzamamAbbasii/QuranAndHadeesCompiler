<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE CHARGERS</P><DIR>

<P>(C. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>By the snorting chargers!</P>
<P>And those who strike fire with their hoofs!</P>
<P>And those who make incursions in the morning, And raise up dust therein, And cleave through a host therein!</P>
<P>Verily, man is to his Lord ungrateful; and, verily, he is a witness of that.</P>
<P>Verily, he is keen in his love of good.</P>
<P>Does he not know when the tombs are exposed, and what is in the breasts is brought to light?</P>
<P>Verily, thy Lord upon that day indeed is well aware.</P>
