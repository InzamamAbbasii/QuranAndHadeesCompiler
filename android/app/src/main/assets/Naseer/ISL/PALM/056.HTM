<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE INEVITABLE</P><DIR>

<P>(LVI. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>When the inevitable happens; none shall call its</P><DIR>

<P>happening a lie!- abasing- exalting!</P></DIR>

<P>When the earth shall quake, quaking! and the mountains</P><DIR>

<P>shall crumble, crumbling, and become like motes dispersed!</P></DIR>

<P>And ye shall be three sorts;</P>
<P>And the fellows of the right hand-what right lucky</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>fellows!</P></DIR>

<P>And the fellows of the left hand-what unlucky fellows!</P>
<P>And the foremost foremost!</P>
<P>These are they who are brought nigh,</P>
<P>In gardens of pleasure!</P>
<P>A crowd of those of yore,</P>
<P>And a few of those of the latter day!</P>
<P>And gold-weft couches, reclining on them face to face.</P></DIR>

<P>Around them shall go eternal youths, with goblets and ewers and a cup of flowing wine; no headache shall they feel therefrom, nor shall their wits be dimmed!</P><DIR>

<P>And fruits such as they deem the best;</P>
<P>And flesh of fowl as they desire;</P>
<P>And bright and large-eyed maids like hidden pearls;</P>
<P>A reward for that which they have done!</P>
<P>They shall hear no folly there and no sin;</P>
<P>Only the speech, ‘Peace, Peace!’</P>
<P>And the fellows of the right-what right lucky fellows!</P>
<P>Amid thornless lote trees.</P>
<P>And tal’h trees with piles of fruit;</P>
<P>And outspread shade,</P>
<P>And water out-poured;</P>
<P>And fruit in abundance, neither failing nor forbidden;</P>
<P>And beds upraised!</P>
<P>Verily, we have produced them a production.</P></DIR>

<P>And made them virgins, darlings of equal age</P><DIR>

<P>(with their spouses) for the fellows of the right!</P></DIR>

<P>A crowd of those of yore, and a crowd of those of the</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>latter day!</P></DIR>

<P>And the fellows of the left-what unlucky fellows!</P>
<P>In hot blasts and boiling water;</P>
<P>And a shade of pitchy smoke,</P>
<P>Neither cool nor generous!</P>
<P>Verily, they were affluent ere this, and did persist in</P>
<P>mighty crime; and used to say, ‘What, when we die and have become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be raised? or our fathers of yore?’</P></DIR>

<P>Say, ‘Verily, those of yore and those of the latter day</P><DIR>

<P>shall surely be gathered together unto the tryst of the well-known day.’</P></DIR>

<P>Then ye, O ye who err! who say it is a lie! shall eat of</P><DIR>

<P>the Zaqqum tree! and fill your bellies with it! and drink thereon of boiling water! and drink as drinks the thirsty camel.</P></DIR>

<P>This is their entertainment on the judgment day!</P>
<P>We created you, then why do ye not credit?</P>
<P>Have ye considered what ye emit?</P>
<P>Do we create it, or are we the creators?</P>
<P>We have decreed amongst you death; but we are not</P><DIR>

<P>forestalled from making the likes of you in exchange, or producing you as ye know not of.</P></DIR>

<P>Ye do know the first production-why then do ye not mind?</P>
<P>Have ye considered what ye till?</P>
<P>Do ye make it bear seed, or do we make it bear seed?</P>
<P>If we pleased we could make it mere grit, so that ye</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>would pause to marvel:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>‘Verily,we have got into debt and we are excluded.’</P>
<P>Have ye considered the water which ye drink?</P>
<P>Do ye make it come down from the clouds, or do we make</P><DIR>

<P>it come down?</P></DIR>

<P>If we pleased we could make it pungent-why then do ye</P><DIR>

<P>not give thanks?</P></DIR>

<P>Have ye considered the fire which ye strike?</P>
<P>Do ye produce the tree that gives it, or do we</P><DIR>

<P>produce it?</P></DIR>

<P>We have made it a memorial and a chattel for the</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>traveller of the waste?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then celebrate the grand name of thy Lord!</P>
<P>So I will not swear by the positions of the stars; and,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>verily, it is a grand oath if ye did but know—that, verily, this is the honourable Koran- in the laid-up Book!</P></DIR>

<P>Let none touch it but the purified!</P>
<P>A revelation from the Lord of the worlds.</P>
<P>What! this new discourse will ye despise?</P>
<P>And make for your provision, that you call it a lie?</P></DIR>

<P>Why then-when it comes up to the throat, and ye at that time look on, though we are nearer to him than you are, but ye cannot see,- why, if ye are not to be judged, do ye not send it back, if ye do tell the truth?</P>
<P>But either, if he be of those brought nigh to God,- then rest and fragrance and the garden of pleasure!</P>
<P>Or, if he be of the fellows of the right! then ‘Peace to thee!’ from the fellows of the right!</P>
<P>Or, if he be of those who say it is a lie,-who err! Then an entertainment of boiling water! and broiling in hell!</P>
<P>Verily, this is surely certain truth!</P>
<P>So celebrate the grand name of thy Lord!</P>
