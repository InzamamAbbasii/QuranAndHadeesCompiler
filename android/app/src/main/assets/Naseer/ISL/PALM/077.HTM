<P>THE CHAPTER OF THOSE SENT</P><DIR>

<P>(LXXVII. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>By those sent in a series!</P>
<P>And by those who speed swiftly!</P>
<P>And by the dispensers abroad!</P>
<P>And by the separators apart!</P>
<P>And by those who instil the reminder, as an excuse</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>or warning!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Verily, what ye are threatened with shall surely happen!</P>
<P>And when the stars shall be erased!</P>
<P>And when the heaven shall be cleft!</P>
<P>And when the mountains shall be winnowed!</P>
<P>And when the apostles shall have a time appointed</P><DIR>

<P>for them!</P></DIR>

<P>For what day is the appointment made?</P>
<P>For the day of decision! and what shall make thee</P><DIR>

<P>know what the decision is?</P></DIR>

<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>Have we not destroyed those of yore, and then followed</P><DIR>

<P>them up with those of the latter day? Thus do we with the sinners.</P></DIR>

<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>Did we not create you from contemptible water, and place</P><DIR>

<P>it in a sure depository unto a certain. decreed term? for we are able and well able too!</P></DIR>

<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>Have we not made for them the earth to hold the living</P><DIR>

<P>and the dead? and set thereon firm mountains reared aloft? and given you to drink water in streams?</P></DIR>

<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>Go off to that which ye did call a lie! Go off to the</P><DIR>

<P>shadow of three columns, that shall not shade nor avail against the flame! Verily, it throws off sparks like towers,-as though they were yellow camels!</P></DIR>

<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>This is the day when they may not speak,- when they are</P><DIR>

<P>not permitted to excuse themselves!</P></DIR>

<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>This is the day of decision! We have assembled you with</P><DIR>

<P>those of yore; if ye have any stratagem employ it now!</P></DIR>

<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>Verily, the pious are amid shades and springs and</P><DIR>

<P>fruit such as they love.-‘Eat and drink with good digestion, for that which ye have done!’</P></DIR>

<P>Verily, thus do we reward those who do well.</P>
<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>‘Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little; verily, ye are</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>sinners!’</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>And when it is said to them bow down, they bow not down.</P>
<P>Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie!</P>
<P>And in what new discourse after it will they believe?</P>
