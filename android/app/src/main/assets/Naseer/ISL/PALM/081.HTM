<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE FOLDING UP</P><DIR>

<P>(LXXXI. Mecca.)</P>
<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>When the sun is folded up,</P>
<P>And when the stars do fall,</P>
<P>And when the mountains are moved,</P>
<P>And when the she-camels ten months’ gone with young</P>
<P>shall be neglected,</P>
<P>And when the beasts shall be crowded together,</P>
<P>And when the seas shall surge up,</P>
<P>And when souls shall be paired with bodies,</P>
<P>And when the child who was buried alive shall be asked</P>
<P>for what sin she was slain,</P>
<P>And when the pages shall be spread out,</P>
<P>And when the heaven shall be flayed,</P>
<P>And when hell shall be set ablaze,</P>
<P>And when Paradise shall be brought nigh,</P>
<P>The soul shall know what it has produced!</P>
<P>I need not swear by the stars that slink back, moving swiftly, slinking into their dens!</P></DIR>

<P>Nor by the night when darkness draws on!</P>
<P>Nor by the morn when it first breathes up!</P>
<P>Verily, it is the speech of a noble apostle, mighty, standing sure with the Lord of the throne, obeyed and trusty too!</P>
<P>Your comrade is not mad; he saw him on the plain horizon, nor does he grudge to communicate the unseen.</P>
<P>Nor is it the speech of a pelted devil.</P>
<P>Then whither do ye go?</P>
<P>It is but a reminder to the worlds, to whomsoever of you pleases to go straight:- but ye will not please, except God, the Lord of the world, should please.</P>
