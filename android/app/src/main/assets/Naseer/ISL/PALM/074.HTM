<P>THE CHAPTER OF THE ‘COVERED’</P><DIR>

<P>(LXXIV. Mecca.)</P></DIR>

<P>IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God.</P>
<P>O thou who art covered! rise up and warn!</P>
<P>And thy Lord magnify!</P>
<P>And thy garments purify!</P>
<P>And abomination shun!</P>
<P>And grant not favours to gain increase!</P>
<P>And for thy Lord await!</P>
<P>And when the trump is blown,-for that day is a difficult day! for the misbelievers aught but easy!</P>
<P>Leave me alone with him I have created, and for whom I have made extensive wealth, and sons that he may look upon, and for whom I have smoothed things down. Then he desires that I should increase! nay, verily, he is hostile to our signs! I will drive him up a hill! Then he reflected and planned! May he be killed,-how he planned! Again, may he be killed,-how he planned! Then he looked; then he frowned and scowled; then he retreated and was big with pride and said, ‘This is only magic exhibited! this is only mortal speech!’- I will broil him in hell-fire! and what shall make thee know what hell-fire is? It will not leave and will not let alone. It scorches the flesh; over it are nineteen (angels).</P>
<P>We have made only angels guardians of the fire, and we have only made their number a trial to those who misbelieve; that those who have been given the Book may be certain, and that those who believe may be increased in faith; and that those who have been given the Book and the believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts is sickness, and the misbelievers may say, ‘What does God mean by this as a parable?’</P>
<P>Thus God leads astray whom He pleases, and guides him He pleases:</P>
<P>and none knows the hosts of thy Lord save Himself; and it is only a reminder to mortals!</P>
<P>Nay, by the moon!</P>
<P>And the night when it retires!</P>
<P>And the morning when it brightly dawns!</P>
<P>Verily, it is one of the greatest misfortunes; a warning to mortals; for him amongst you who wishes to press forward or to tarry! Every soul is pledged for what it earns; except the fellows of the right: in gardens shall they ask each other about the sinners!-‘What drove you into hell-fire?’</P>
<P>They shall say, ‘We weren’t of those who prayed; we didn’t feed the poor; but we did plunge into discussion with those who plunged, and we called the judgment day a lie until the certainty did come to us!’</P>
<P>But there shall not profit them the intercession of the intercessors.</P>
<P>What ailed them that they turned away from the memorial as though they were timid asses fleeing from a lion?</P>
<P>Nay, every man of them wished that he might have given him books spread open!</P>
<P>Nay, but they did not fear the hereafter!</P>
<P>Nay, it is a memorial! and let him who will remember it; but none will remember it except God please. He is most worthy of fear; and he is most worthy to forgive!</P>
